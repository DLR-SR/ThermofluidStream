# <img src="/doc/logo_lib.png" width="50"> The DLR Thermofluid Stream Library  

The DLR Thermofluid Stream Library is a free open-source library for the robust modeling of complex thermofluid architectures. Designed to be easy to use and easy to adapt and enriched by a number of examples, this library can be used as basis for many different applications such as thermal management of electric cars, power plants, or building physics.

## Highlights

- **Winner of the 2021 Modelica Library Award (1st prize) at the International Modelica Conference**
- Robust modeling of even complex architectures due to new computational scheme
- Easy to initialize and good support for switching bypasses and other configuration changes
- Many examples that enable an easy start to working with this library.
- Many base components that are easy to read, understand and to adapt to your own needs
- Support for systems that reverse their flow direction such as combined heat-pump/vapour cycle
- Support for discretized heat exchangers


## Technical Background
The DLR ThermoFluid Stream Library uses a [innovative computational scheme](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13873954.2020.1757726) that has been developed for the object-oriented formulation of even complex system architectures. Key is the decomposition of pressure into a steady-flow component and an inertial component driving the balance of mass-flows. Using this decomposition all non-linear equations can be brought into explicit form and what remains to be solved is a purely linear equation system.

## Tool compatibility 
- [Dymola](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/catia/products/dymola/): The library has been developed using Dymola and is based on Modelica 3.2.3. Pedantic checking has been applied to all components in order to improve cross-tool compatibility. 
- [Open Modelica](https://www.openmodelica.org/): To a large extent, the library is compatible to Open Modelica. Details in [Issue 10](https://github.com/DLR-SR/ThermofluidStream/issues/10): 
- [Modelon Impact](https://www.modelon.com/modelon-impact/): The library is reported to be fully compatible to Modelon Impact. Details in [Issue 19](https://github.com/DLR-SR/ThermofluidStream/issues/19).
