# The DLR Thermofluid Stream Library

The DLR Thermofluid Stream Library is a free open-source library for the robust modeling of complex thermofluid architectures. Designed to be easy to use and easy to adapt and enriched by a number of examples, this library can be used as basis for many different applications such as thermal management of electric cars, power plants, or building physics.


## Highlights
- Robust modeling of even complex architectures due to new computational scheme
- Easy to initialize good support for switching bypasses and other configuration changes
- Many examples that enable an easy start to working with this library.
- Many base components that are easy to read, understand and to adapt to your own needs
- Support for systems that reverse their flow direction such as combined heat-pump/vapour cycle
- Support for discretized heat exchangers

## Tool compatibility 
The library has been developed using Dymola and is based on Modelica 3.2.3. Pendantic checking has been applied to all components in order to improve cross-tool compatibility. We will work to improve compatibility to OpenModelica.

## Acknowledgements

This work has been partially supported by the Helmholtz Gemeinschaft in frame of the research project for on-board diagnosis. Hence we would also like to thank the team of Robert Bosch GmbH for feedback and motivating use-case scenarios. Further thanks goes to Chistopher Laughman from Mitsubishi Electronic Research Center for providing initial feedback. Also the work of Tobias Krenz form TU Darmstadt was providing motivating use cases of the new approach. We are still grateful to Airbus and our former colleagues Dr Alexander Pollok and Dr. Daniel Bender who were pioneering the new methodology. Also we like to thank our colleague Dr. Peter Eschenbacher for his valuable modeling experience on valves and pumps.
