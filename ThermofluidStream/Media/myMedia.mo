<h4>Basic usage of medium model</h4>
<p>
Media models in Modelica.Media are provided by packages, inheriting from the
partial package Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium. Every package defines:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Medium <strong>constants</strong> (such as the number of chemical substances,
     molecular data, critical properties, etc.).</li>
<li> A BaseProperties <strong>model</strong>, to compute the basic thermodynamic
     properties of the fluid;</li>
<li> <strong>setState_XXX</strong> functions to compute the thermodynamic state record from
     different input arguments (such as density, temperature, and composition which
     would be setState_dTX);</li>
<li> <strong>Functions</strong> to compute additional properties (such as saturation
     properties, viscosity, thermal conductivity, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are - as stated above - two different basic ways of using the Media library which
will be described in more details in the following section. One way is to use the model BaseProperties.
Every instance of BaseProperties for any medium model provides <strong>3+nXi
equations</strong> for the following <strong>5+nXi variables</strong> that are declared in
the medium model (nXi is the number of independent mass fractions, see
explanation below):
</p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2>
  <tr><td><strong>Variable</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Unit</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr>
  <tr><td>T</td>
      <td>K</td>
      <td>temperature</td></tr>
  <tr><td>p</td>
      <td>Pa</td>
      <td>absolute pressure</td></tr>
  <tr><td>d</td>
      <td>kg/m3</td>
      <td>density</td></tr>

      <td>J/kg</td>

  <tr><td>Xi[nXi]</td>
      <td>kg/kg</td>
      <td>independent mass fractions m_i/m</td></tr>
  <tr><td>X[nX]</td>
      <td>kg/kg</td>
      <td>All mass fractions m_i/m. X is defined in BaseProperties by:<br>
          X = <strong>if</strong> reducedX <strong>then</strong> vector([Xi; 1-<strong>sum</strong>(Xi)])
          <strong>else</strong> Xi </td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<strong>Two</strong> variables out of p, d, h, or u, as well as the
<strong>mass fractions</strong> Xi are the <strong>independent</strong> variables and the
medium model basically provides equations to compute
the remaining variables, including the full mass fraction vector X
(more details to Xi and X are given further below).
</p>
<p>
In a component, the most basic usage of a medium model is as follows
</p>
<pre>
  <strong>model</strong> Pump
    <strong>replaceable package</strong> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium
                         \"Medium model\" <strong>annotation</strong> (choicesAllMatching = <strong>true</strong>);
    Medium.BaseProperties medium_a \"Medium properties at location a (e.g., port_a)\";
    // Use medium variables (medium_a.p, medium_a.T, medium_a.h, ...)
     ...
  <strong>end</strong> Pump;
</pre>
<p>
The second way is to use the setState_XXX functions to compute the thermodynamic state
record from which all other thermodynamic state variables can be computed (see
<a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Media.UsersGuide.MediumDefinition.BasicDefinition\">
Basic definition of medium</a> for further details on ThermodynamicState). The setState_XXX functions
accept either X or Xi (see explanation below) and will decide internally which of these two compositions
is provided by the user. The four fundamental setState_XXX functions are provided in PartialMedium
</p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2>
  <tr><td><strong>Function</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Description</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Short-form for<br>single component medium</strong></td></tr>
  <tr><td>setState_dTX</td>
      <td>computes ThermodynamicState from density, temperature, and composition X or Xi</td>
      <td>setState_dT</td></tr>
  <tr><td>setState_phX</td>
      <td>computes ThermodynamicState from pressure, specific enthalpy, and composition X or Xi</td>
      <td>setState_ph</td></tr>
  <tr><td>setState_psX</td>
      <td>computes ThermodynamicState from pressure, specific entropy, and composition X or Xi</td>
      <td>setState_ps</td></tr>
  <tr><td>setState_pTX</td>
      <td>computes ThermodynamicState from pressure, temperature, and composition X or Xi</td>
      <td>setState_pT</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The simple example that explained the basic usage of BaseProperties would then become
</p>
<pre>
  <strong>model</strong> Pump
    <strong>replaceable package</strong> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium
                         \"Medium model\" <strong>annotation</strong> (choicesAllMatching = <strong>true</strong>);
    Medium.ThermodynamicState state_a \"Thermodynamic state record at location a (e.g., port_a)\";
    // Compute medium variables from thermodynamic state record (pressure(state_a), temperature(state_a),
    // specificEnthalpy(state_a), ...)
    ...
  <strong>end</strong> Pump;
</pre>
<p>
All media models are directly or indirectly a subpackage of package
Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium. Therefore,
a medium model in a component should inherit from this
partial package. Via the annotation \"choicesAllMatching = true\" it
is defined that the tool should display a selection box with
all loaded packages that inherit from PartialMedium. An example
is given in the next figure:
</p>

<p>
<img src=\"modelica://Modelica/Resources/Images/Media/UsersGuide/mediumMenu.png\" alt=\"medium selection menu\">
</p>

<p>
A selected medium model leads, e.g., to the following equation:
</p>
<pre>
  Pump pump(<strong>redeclare package</strong> Medium = Modelica.Media.Water.SimpleLiquidWater);
</pre>
<p>
Usually, a medium model is associated with the variables of a
fluid connector. Therefore, equations have to be defined in a model
that relate the variables in the connector with the variables
in the medium model:
</p>
<pre>
  <strong>model</strong> Pump
    <strong>replaceable package</strong> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium
                         \"Medium model\" <strong>annotation</strong> (choicesAllMatching = <strong>true</strong>);
    Medium.BaseProperties medium_a \"Medium properties of port_a\";
    // definition of the fluid port port_a
     ...
  <strong>equation</strong>
    medium.p = port_a.p;
    medium.h = port_a.h;
    medium.Xi = port_a.Xi;
     ...
  <strong>end</strong> Pump;
</pre>
in the case of using BaseProperties or
<pre>
  <strong>model</strong> Pump
    <strong>replaceable package</strong> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium
                         \"Medium model\" <strong>annotation</strong> (choicesAllMatching = <strong>true</strong>);
    Medium.ThermodynamicState state_a \"Thermodynamic state record of medium at port_a\";
    // definition of the fluid port port_a
     ...
  <strong>equation</strong>
    state_a = Medium.setState_phX(port_a.p, port_a.h, port_a.Xi) // if port_a contains the variables
                                                                 // p, h, and Xi
     ...
  <strong>end</strong> Pump;
</pre>
<p>
in the case of using ThermodynamicState.
</p>
<p>
If a component model shall treat both single and multiple
substance fluids, equations for the mass fractions have to be
present (above: medium.Xi = port_a.Xi) in the model. According
to the Modelica semantics, the equations of the mass fractions
are ignored, if the dimension of Xi is zero, i.e., for a single-component
medium. Note, by specific techniques sketched in section
\"Medium definition\", the independent variables in the medium model
need not to be the same as the variables in the connector and still
get the same efficiency, as if the same variables would be used.
</p>

<p>
If a fluid consists of a single
substance, <strong>nXi = 0</strong> and the vector of mass fractions Xi is not
present. If a fluid consists of nS substances,
the medium model may define the number of independent
mass fractions <strong>nXi</strong> to be <strong>nS</strong>, <strong>nS-1</strong>, or zero.
In all cases, balance equations for nXi substances have to be
given in the corresponding component (see discussion below).
Note, that if nXi = nS, the constraint \"sum(Xi)=1\" between the mass
fractions is <strong>not</strong> present in the model; in that case, it is necessary to
provide consistent start values for Xi such that sum(Xi) = 1.
</p>

<p>
The reason for this definition of Xi is that a fluid component library
can be implemented by using only the independent mass fractions Xi and
then via the medium it is defined how Xi is interpreted:
</p>

<ul>
<li> If Xi = nS, then the constraint equation sum(X) = 1 is neglected
     during simulation. By making sure that the initial conditions of X
     fulfill this constraint, it can usually be guaranteed that small
     errors in sum(X) = 1 remain small although this constraint equation is
     not explicitly used during the simulation. This approach is usually useful
     if components of the mixture can become very small. If such a small
     quantity is computed via the equation 1 - sum(X[1:nX-1]), there might
     be large numerical errors and it is better to compute it via
     the corresponding balance equation.</li>
<li> If Xi = nS-1, then the true independent mass fractions are used
     in the fluid component and the last component of X is computed via
     X[nX] = 1 - sum(Xi). This is useful for, e.g., MoistAir, where the
     number of states should be as small as possible without introducing
     numerical problems.</li>
<li> If Xi = 0, then the reference value of composition reference_X is
     assumed. This case is useful to avoid composition states in all
     the cases when the composition will always be constant, e.g., with
     circuits having fixed composition sources.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The full vector of mass fractions <strong>X[nX]</strong> is computed in
PartialMedium.BaseProperties based on Xi, reference_X, and the information whether Xi = nS or nS-1. For single-substance media, nX = 0, so there's also no X vector. For multiple-substance media, nX = nS, and X always contains the full vector of mass fractions. In order to reduce confusion for the user of a fluid component library, \"Xi\" has the annotation \"HideResult=true\", meaning, that this variable is not shown in the plot window. Only X is shown in the plot window and this vector always contains all mass fractions.

      end BasicUsage;

      class BalanceVolume "Balance volume"
        extends Modelica.Icons.Information;

        annotation (Documentation(info="<html>
<p>
Fluid libraries usually have balance volume components with one fluid connector
port that fulfill the mass and energy balance and on a different grid components that
fulfill the momentum balance. A balance volume component, called junction
volume below, should be primarily implemented in the following way
(see also the implementation in
<a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Media.Examples.Utilities.PortVolume\">
Modelica.Media.Examples.Utilities.PortVolume</a>):
</p>
<pre>
  <strong>model</strong> JunctionVolume
    <strong>import</strong> SI=Modelica.SIunits;
    <strong>import</strong> Modelica.Media.Examples.Utilities.FluidPort_a;

    <strong>parameter</strong> SI.Volume V = 1e-6 \"Fixed size of junction volume\";
    <strong>replaceable package</strong> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium
                           \"Medium model\" <strong>annotation</strong> (choicesAllMatching = <strong>true</strong>);

    FluidPort_a port(<strong>redeclare package</strong> Medium = Medium);
    Medium.BaseProperties medium(preferredMediumStates = <strong>true</strong>);

    SI.Energy U               \"Internal energy of junction volume\";
    SI.Mass   M               \"Mass of junction volume\";
    SI.Mass   MX[Medium.nXi] \"Independent substance masses of junction volume\";
  <strong>equation</strong>
    medium.p   = port.p;
    medium.h   = port.h;
    medium.Xi = port.Xi;

    M  = V*medium.d;                  // mass of JunctionVolume
    MX = M*medium.Xi;                // mass fractions in JunctionVolume
    U  = M*medium.u;                  // internal energy in JunctionVolume

    <strong>der</strong>(M)  = port.m_flow;    // mass balance
    <strong>der</strong>(MX) = port.mX_flow;   // substance mass balance
    <strong>der</strong>(U)  = port.H_flow;    // energy balance
  <strong>end</strong> JunctionVolume;
</pre>
<p>
Assume the Modelica.Media.Air.SimpleAir medium model is used with
the JunctionVolume model above. This medium model uses pressure p
and temperature T as independent variables. If the flag
\"preferredMediumStates\" is set to <strong>true</strong> in the declaration
of \"medium\", then the independent variables of this medium model
get the attribute \"stateSelect = StateSelect.prefer\", i.e., the
Modelica translator should use these variables as states, if this
is possible. Basically, this means that
constraints between the
potential states p,T and the potential states U,M are present.
A Modelica tool will therefore <strong>automatically</strong>
differentiate medium equations and will use the following
equations for code generation (note the equations related to X are
removed, because SimpleAir consists of a single substance only):
</p>
<pre>
    M  = V*medium.d;
    U  = M*medium.u;

    // balance equations
    <strong>der</strong>(M)  = port.m_flow;
    <strong>der</strong>(U)  = port.H_flow;

    // abbreviations introduced to get simpler terms
    p = medium.p;
    T = medium.T;
    d = medium.d;
    u = medium.u;
    h = medium.h;

    // medium equations
    d = fd(p,T);
    h = fh(p,T);
    u = h - p/d;

    // equations derived <strong>automatically</strong> by a Modelica tool due to index reduction
    <strong>der</strong>(U) = <strong>der</strong>(M)*u + M*<strong>der</strong>(u);
    <strong>der</strong>(M) = V*<strong>der</strong>(d);
    <strong>der</strong>(u) = <strong>der</strong>(h) - <strong>der</strong>(p)/d - p/<strong>der</strong>(d);
    <strong>der</strong>(d) = <strong>der</strong>(fd,p)*<strong>der</strong>(p) + <strong>der</strong>(fd,T)*<strong>der</strong>(T);
    <strong>der</strong>(h) = <strong>der</strong>(fh,p)*<strong>der</strong>(p) + <strong>der</strong>(fd,T)*<strong>der</strong>(T);
</pre>
<p>
Note, that \"der(y,x)\" is an operator that characterizes
in the example above the partial derivative of y with respect to x
(this operator will be included in one of the next Modelica language
releases).
All media models in this library are written in such a way that
at least the partial derivatives of the medium variables with
respect to the independent variables are provided, either because
the equations are directly given (= symbolic differentiation is possible)
or because the derivative of the corresponding function (such as fd above)
is provided. A Modelica tool will transform the equations above
in differential equations with p and T as states, i.e., will
generate equations to compute <strong>der</strong>(p) and <strong>der</strong>(T) as function of p and T.
</p>

<p>
Note, when preferredMediumStates = <strong>false</strong>, no differentiation
will take place and the Modelica translator will use the variables
appearing differentiated as states, i.e., M and U. This has the
disadvantage that for many media non-linear systems of equations are
present to compute the intrinsic properties p, d, T, u, h from
M and U.

      class ShortPipe "Short pipe"
        extends Modelica.Icons.Information;

        annotation (Documentation(info="<html>
<p>
Fluid libraries have components with two ports that store
neither mass nor energy and fulfill the
momentum equation between their two ports, e.g., a short pipe. In most
cases this means that an equation is present relating the pressure
drop between the two ports and the mass flow rate from one to the
other port. Since no mass or energy is stored, no differential
equations for thermodynamic variables are present. A component model of this type
has therefore usually the following structure
(see also the implementation in
<a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Media.Examples.Utilities.ShortPipe\">
Modelica.Media.Examples.Utilities.ShortPipe</a>):
</p>

    // define media models of the ports
    medium_a.p   = port_a.p;
    medium_a.h   = port_a.h;
    medium_a.Xi = port_a.Xi;

    medium_b.p   = port_b.p;
    medium_b.h   = port_b.h;
    medium_b.Xi = port_b.Xi;

    // Handle reverse and zero flow (semiLinear is a built-in Modelica operator)
    port_a.H_flow   = <strong>semiLinear</strong>(port_a.m_flow, port_a.h, port_b.h);
    port_a.mXi_flow = <strong>semiLinear</strong>(port_a.m_flow, port_a.Xi, port_b.Xi);

    // Energy, mass and substance mass balance
    port_a.H_flow + port_b.H_flow = 0;
    port_a.m_flow + port_b.m_flow = 0;
    port_a.mXi_flow + port_b.mXi_flow = zeros(Medium.nXi);

    // Provide equation: port_a.m_flow = f(dp)
  <strong>end</strong> ShortPipe;

<p>
The <strong>semiLinear</strong>(..) operator is basically defined as:
</p>
<pre>
    semiLinear(m_flow, ha, hb) = if m_flow &ge; 0 then m_flow*ha else m_flow*hb;
</pre>

<p>
that is, it computes the enthalpy flow rate either from the port_a or
from the port_b properties, depending on flow direction. The exact
details of this operator are given in
<a href=\"modelica://ModelicaReference.Operators.'semiLinear()'\">
ModelicaReference.Operators.'semiLinear()'</a>. Especially, rules
are defined in the Modelica specification that m_flow = 0 can be treated
in a \"meaningful way\". Especially, if n fluid components (such as pipes)
are connected together and the fluid connector from above is used,
a linear system of equations appear between
medium1.h, medium2.h, medium3.h, ..., port1.h, port2.h, port3.h, ...,
port1.H_flow, port2.H_flow, port3.H_flow, .... The rules for the
semiLinear(..) operator allow the following solution of this
linear system of equations:
</p>

<ul>
<li> n = 2 (two components are connected):<br>
     The linear system of equations can be analytically solved
     with the result
     <pre>
     medium1.h = medium2.h = port1.h = port2.h
     0 = port1.H_flow + port2.H_flow
     </pre>
     Therefore, no problems with zero mass flow rate are present.</li>

<li> n &gt; 2 (more than two components are connected together):<br>
     The linear system of equations is solved numerically during simulation.
     For m_flow = 0, the linear system becomes singular and has an
     infinite number of solutions. The simulator could use the solution t
     that is closest to the solution in the previous time step
     (\"least squares solution\"). Physically, the solution is determined
     by diffusion which is usually neglected. If diffusion is included,
     the linear system is regular.</li>

        extends Modelica.Icons.Information;

        annotation (Documentation(info="<html>
<p>
In some cases additional medium properties are needed.
A component that needs these optional properties has to call
one of the functions listed in the following table. They are
defined as partial functions within package
<a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium\">PartialMedium</a>,
and then (optionally) implemented in actual medium packages.
If a component calls such an optional function and the
medium package does not provide a new implementation for this
function, an error message is printed at translation time,
since the function is \"partial\", i.e., incomplete.
The argument of all functions is the <strong>state</strong> record,
automatically defined by the BaseProperties model or specifically computed using the
setState_XXX functions, which contains the
minimum number of thermodynamic variables needed to compute all the additional
properties. In the table it is assumed that there is a declaration of the

There are also some short forms provided for user convenience that allow the computation of certain
thermodynamic state variables without using the ThermodynamicState record explicitly. Those short forms
are for example useful to compute consistent start values in the initial equation section. Let's
consider the function temperature_phX(p,h,X) as an example. This function computes the temperature
from pressure, specific enthalpy, and composition X (or Xi) and is a short form for writing
</p>
<pre>
  temperature(setState_phX(p,h,X))

Assume for example that the dynamic viscosity eta is needed in
the pressure drop equation of a short pipe. Then, the

Models for media which can exist in one-phase or two-phase conditions inherit
from <a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialTwoPhaseMedium\">
Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialTwoPhaseMedium</a>
(which inherits from PartialMedium). The basic usage of these
media models is the same as described in the previous sections. However, additional
functionalities are provided, which apply only to potentially two-phase media.
</p>
<p>
The following additional medium <strong>constants</strong> are provided:
</p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2>

      <td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Boolean</td>
      <td>smoothModel</td>

          whenever the saturation boundary is crossed; otherwise, no events
      are generated.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Boolean</td>
      <td>onePhase</td>
      <td>If this flag is true, then the medium model assumes it will be never
          called in the two-phase region. This can be useful to speed up

      always work in the one-phase region. Default value: false.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The setState_ph(), setState_ps(), setState_dT() and setState_pT() functions have
one extra input, named <em>phase</em>. If the phase input is not specified, or if
it is given a value of zero, then the setState function will determine the phase,
based on the other input values. An input phase = 1 will force the setState
function to return a state vector corresponding to a one-phase state, while
phase = 2 will force the setState value to return a state vector corresponding
to a two-phase state, as shown in the following example;
</p>
<pre>
   <strong>replaceable package</strong> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialTwoPhaseMedium;
   Medium.ThermodynamicState state, state1, state2;
 <strong>equation</strong>
   // Set the state, given the pressure and the specific enthalpy
   // the phase is determined by the (p, h) values, and can be retrieved
   // from the state record
   state = Medium.setState_ph(p, h);
   phase = state1.phase;

   // Force the computation of the state with one-phase
   // equations of state, irrespective of the (p, h) values
   state1 = Medium.setState_ph(p, h, 1);

   // Force the computation of the state with 2-phase
   // equations of state, irrespective of the (p, h) values
   state2 = Medium.setState_ph(p, h, 2);
</pre>
<p>
This feature can be used for the following purposes:
</p>
<ul>
<li> saving computational time, if one knows in advance the phase of the medium;</li>
<li> unambiguously determine the phase, when the two inputs correspond to a point on the saturation boundary (the derivative functions have substantially different values on either side);</li>
<li> get the properties of metastable states, like superheated water or subcooled vapour.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Many additional optional functions are defined to compute properties of
saturated media, either liquid (bubble point) or vapour (dew point).
The argument to such functions is a SaturationProperties record, which can be
set starting from either the saturation pressure or the saturation temperature,
as shown in the following example.

<pre>
   <strong>replaceable package</strong> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialTwoPhaseMedium;
   Medium.SaturationProperties sat_p;

   sat_p = Medium.setSat_p(p);

   // Compute saturation properties at pressure p
   saturationTemperature_p = Medium.saturationTemperature_sat(sat_p);
   bubble_density_p =        Medium.bubbleDensity(sat_p);
   dew_enthalpy_p   =        Medium.dewEnthalpy(sat_p);

   // Set sat_T to saturation properties at temperature T
   sat_T = Medium.setSat_T(T);

   // Compute saturation properties at temperature T
   saturationTemperature_T = Medium.saturationPressure_sat(sat_T);
   bubble_density_T =        Medium.bubbleDensity(sat_T);
   dew_enthalpy_T =          Medium.dewEnthalpy(sat_T);

Sometimes it can be necessary to compute fluid properties in the thermodynamic

When a medium model is used in a balance volume, differential
equations for the independent medium variables are present and
therefore initial conditions have to be provided.
The following possibilities exist:
</p>

<h4>Steady state initialization</h4>
<p>
Modelica has currently no language element to define
steady state initialization. In the Modelica simulation
environment Dymola, the option
</p>
<pre>
   Advanced.DefaultSteadyStateInitialization = <strong>true</strong>
</pre>
<p>
can be set before translation. Then, missing initial
conditions are provided by automatically setting appropriate
state derivatives to zero.
</p>

<h4>Explicit start values or initial equations</h4>
<p>
Explicit start values can be defined with the \"start\" and
\"fixed\" attributes. The number of independent variables nx
need to be known which can be deduced from the medium
constants (nx = nXi + <strong>if</strong> singleState <strong>then</strong> 1 <strong>else</strong> 2).
Then, start values or initial equations can be defined
for nx variables (= p, T, d, u, h, Xi) from Medium.BaseProperties,
e.g., in the form:
</p>
<pre>
     <strong>replaceable</strong> package Medium = Medium.Interfaces.PartialMedium;
     Medium.BaseProperties medium1 (p(start=1e5, fixed=<strong>not</strong> Medium.singleState),
                                    T(start=300, fixed=<strong>true</strong>));
     Medium.BaseProperties medium2;
  <strong>initial equation</strong>
     <strong>if not</strong> Medium.singleState <strong>then</strong>
        medium2.p = 1e5;
     <strong>end if</strong>;
     medium2.T = 300;
  <strong>equation</strong>
  </pre>
<p>
If initial conditions are not provided for the independent
medium variables, non-linear systems of equations may
occur to compute the initial values of the independent
medium variables from the provided initial conditions.
</p>

<h4>Guess values</h4>
<p>
If non-linear systems of equations occur during initialization,
e.g., in case of steady state initialization, guess values
for the iteration variables of the non-linear system of equations
have to be provided via the \"start\" attribute (and fixed=false).
Unfortunately, it is usually not known in
advance which variables are selected as iteration variables of
a non-linear system of equations. One of the following possibilities
exist:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Do not supply start values and hope that the medium specific
     types have meaningful start values, such as in \"Medium.AbsolutePressure\"
     </li>
<li> Supply start values on all variables of the BaseProperties model,
     i.e., on p, T, d, u, h, Xi.</li>
<li> Determine the iteration variables of the non-linear systems of
     equations and provide start values for these variables.
     In the Modelica simulation environment Dymola, the iteration
     variables can be determined by setting the command
     <code>Advanced.OutputModelicaCode = <strong>true</strong></code>
     and by inspection of the file \"dsmodel.mof\" that is generated
     when this option is set (search for \"nonlinear\").</li>

A medium model of Modelica.Media is essentially a <strong>package</strong>
that contains the following definitions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Definition of <strong>constants</strong>, such as the medium name.</li>
<li>
A <strong>model</strong> in the package that contains the 3 basic
thermodynamic equations that relate the 5+nXi primary medium variables.</li>
<li><strong>Optional functions</strong> to compute medium properties that are
only needed in certain circumstances, such as dynamic viscosity. These optional
functions need not be provided by every medium model.</li>
<li>
<strong>Type</strong> definitions, which are adapted to the particular
medium. For example, a type <strong>Temperature</strong> is defined where the attributes
<strong>min</strong>
and <strong>max</strong> define the validity region of the medium, and a suitable default
start value is given. In a device model, it is advisable to use these type
definitions, e.g., for parameters, in order that medium limits are checked as

</pre>
<p>
We will discuss all parts of this package in the
following paragraphs. An actual medium model should extend from PartialMedium
and has to provide implementations of the various parts.
</p>

<p>
Some of the constants at the beginning of the package do not have a value yet
(this is valid in Modelica), but a value has to be provided when extending from
package PartialMedium. A given value can be modified until the model is
translated or the <strong>final</strong> prefix is set.
The reason to use constants instead of parameters in the model BaseProperties
is that some of these constants are used in a context where parameters
are not allowed. For example, in connector definitions the
number of independent mass fractions nXi is used as dimension
of a vector Xi. When defining the
connector, only <em>constants</em> in packages can be accessed, but not
<em>parameters</em> in a model, because a connector cannot contain an instance
of BaseProperties.
</p>

<p>The record BasePropertiesRecord contains the variables
primarily used in balance equations. Three equations for these variables have
to be provided by every medium in model BaseProperties, plus two equations
for the gas constant and the molar mass.
</p>

<p>Optional medium properties are defined by functions, such as the function
dynamicViscosity (see code Section above) to compute the dynamic viscosity.
The argument of those functions is the ThermodynamicState record, defined
in BaseProperties, which contains the minimum number of thermodynamic variables
needed as an input to compute all the optional properties.
This construction simplifies the usage
considerably as demonstrated in the following code fragment:
</p>

<pre>
  <strong>replaceable package</strong> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium;
  Medium.BaseProperties   medium;
  Medium.DynamicViscosity eta;
  ...
  U   = m*medium.u; //Internal energy
  eta = Medium.dynamicViscosity(medium.state);
</pre>

<p>Medium is the medium package that satisfies the
requirements of a PartialMedium (when using the model above, a value for
Medium has to be provided by a redeclaration). The medium component is an
instance of the model Medium.BaseProperties and contains the core medium
equations. Variables in this model can be accessed just by dot-notation, such
as medium.u or medium.T. If an optional medium variable has to be computed, the
corresponding function from the actual Medium package is called, such as
Medium.dynamicViscosity. The medium.state vector can be given as input argument
to this function, and its fields are kept consistent to those of BaseProperties
by suitable equations, contained in BaseProperties itself (see above).
</p>

<p>If a medium model does not provide implementations of all
optional functions and one of these functions is called in a model, an error
occurs during translation since the optional functions which have not been
redeclared have the <em>partial</em> attribute. For example, if function
dynamicViscosity is not provided in the medium model when it is used, only
simple pressure drop loss models without a reference to the viscosity can be
used and not the sophisticated ones.
</p>

<p>At the bottom of the PartialMedium package type declarations
are present, that are used in all other parts of the PartialMedium package and
that should be used in all models and connectors where a medium model is
accessed. The reason is that minimum, maximum, nominal, and start
values are defined and these values can be adapted to the particular medium at
hand. For example, the nominal value of AbsolutePressure is 10<sup>5</sup>
Pa. If a simple model of water steam is used that is only valid above 100 &deg;C,
then the minimum value in the Temperature type should be set to this value. The
minimum and maximum values are also important for parameters in order to get an
early message if data outside of the validity region is given. The nominal
attribute is important as a scaling value if the variable is used as a state in
a differential equation or as an iteration variable in a non-linear system of
equations. The start attribute can be very useful to provide a meaningful
default start or guess value if the variable is used, e.g., as iteration
variable in a non-linear system of equations. Note, that all these attributes
can be set specifically for a medium in the following way:
</p>

<pre>
<strong>package</strong> MyMedium
  <strong>extends</strong> Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium(
     ...
     Temperature(min=373));
<strong>end</strong> MyMedium;
</pre>

<p>
The type PartialMedium.MassFlowRate is defined as
</p>

<pre>
<strong>type</strong> MassFlowRate = Modelica.SIunits.MassFlowRate
     (quantity = \"MassFlowRate.\" + mediumName);
</pre>

<p>Note that the constant mediumName, that has to be
defined in every medium model, is used in the quantity attribute. For example,
if mediumName = SimpleLiquidWater, then the quantity attribute has the value
MassFlowRate.SimpleLiquidWater. This type should be used in a connector
definition of a fluid library:
</p>

<pre>
<strong>connector</strong> FluidPort
  <strong>replaceable package</strong> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium;
  <strong>flow</strong> Medium.MassFlowRate m_flow;
  ...
<strong>end</strong> FluidPort;
</pre>

<p>In the model where this connector is used, the actual
Medium has to be defined. Connectors can only be connected together, if the
corresponding attributes are either not defined or have identical values. Since
mediumName is part of the quantity attribute of MassFlowRate, it is not
possible to connect connectors with different media models together.</p>

      class BasicDefinition "Basic definition"
        extends Modelica.Icons.Information;

        annotation (Documentation(info="<html>
<p>
Let's now walk through the definition of a new medium model. Please refer to
<a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Media.Interfaces.TemplateMedium\">
Modelica.Media.Interfaces.TemplateMedium</a> to obtain a template of the new
medium model code. For the moment being, consider a single-substance medium
model.
</p>
<p>
The new medium model is obtained by extending Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium, and
setting the following package constants:
</p>
<ul>
<li>mediumName is a String containing the name of the medium.</li>
<li>substanceNames is a vector of strings containing the names of the substances
    that make up the medium. In this case, it will contain only mediumName.</li>
<li>singleState can be set to true if u and d in BaseProperties do not depend
    on pressure. In other words, density does not depend on pressure
    (incompressible fluid), and it is assumed that also u does not depend on
    pressure. This setting can be useful for fluids having high density and
    low compressibility (e.g., liquids at moderate pressure); fast states
    resulting from the low compressibility effects are automatically avoided.</li>
<li>reducedX = true for single-substance media, which do not need mass
    fractions at all.</li>
</ul>
<p>
It is also possible to change the default min, max, nominal, and start
attributes of Medium-defined types (see TemplateMedium).</p>
<p>
All other package constants, such as nX, nXi, nS, are automatically set
by the declarations of the base package Interfaces.PartialMedium.</p>
<p>
The second step is to provide an implementation to the BaseProperties model,
partially defined in the base class Interfaces.PartialMedium. In the case of
single-substance media, two independent state variables must be selected among
p, T, d, u, h, and three equations must be written to provide the values of
the remaining variables. Two equations must then be added to compute the molar
mass MM and the gas constant R.</p>
<p>
The third step is to consider the optional functions that are going to be
implemented, among the partial functions defined by the base class PartialMedium.
A minimal set of state variables that could be provided as an input to
<em>all</em> those functions must be selected, and included in the redeclaration
of the ThermodynamicState record. Subsequently, equations must be added to
BaseProperties in order that the instance of that record inside BaseProperties
(named \"state\") is kept updated. For example, assume that all additional
properties can be computed as a function of p and T. Then, ThermodynamicState
should be redeclared as follows:</p>
<pre>
  <strong>redeclare replaceable record</strong> ThermodynamicState
    AbsolutePressure p \"Absolute pressure of medium\";
    Temperature T \"Temperature of medium\";
  <strong>end</strong> ThermodynamicState;
</pre>
<p>
and the following equations should be added to BaseProperties:
</p>
<pre>
  state.p = p;
  state.T = T;
</pre>
<p>
The additional functions can now be implemented by redeclaring the functions
defined in the base class and adding their algorithms, e.g.:
</p>
<pre>
    <strong>redeclare function extends</strong> dynamicViscosity \"Return dynamic viscosity\"
    <strong>algorithm</strong>
      eta := 10 - state.T*0.3 + state.p*0.2;
    <strong>end</strong> dynamicViscosity;
</pre>

      class MultipleSubstances "Multiple Substances"
        extends Modelica.Icons.Information;

        annotation (Documentation(info="<html>
<p>
When writing the model of a multiple-substance medium, a fundamental issue
concerns how to consider the mass fractions of the fluid. If there are nS
substances, there are also nS mass fractions; however, one of them is redundant,
as sum(X) = 1. Therefore there are basically two options, concerning the number
of independent mass fractions nXi:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <em>Reduced-state models</em>: reducedX = <strong>true</strong> and nXi = nS - 1. In this
case, the number of independent mass fractions nXi is the minimum possible.
The full state vector X is provided by equations declared in the base class
Interfaces.PartialMedium.BaseProperties: the first nXi elements are equal to
Xi, and the last one is 1 - sum(Xi).</li>
<li> <em>Full-state models</em>: reducedX = <strong>false</strong> and nXi = nS. In this case,
Xi = X, i.e., all the elements of the composition vector are considered as
independent variables, and the constraint sum(X) = 1 is never written explicitly.
Although this kind of model is heavier, as it provides one extra state variable,
it can be less prone to numerical and/or symbolic problems, which can be
caused by that constraint.</li>
<li> <em>Fixed-composition models</em>: fixedX = <strong>true</strong> and nXi = 0. In this case X = reference_X, i.e., all the elements of the composition vector are fixed.</li>
</ul>
<p> The medium implementer can declare the value reducedX as <strong>final</strong>. In
this way only one implementation must be given. For instance,
Modelica.Media.IdealGases models declare <strong>final</strong> reducedX = <strong>false</strong>, so that the
implementation can always assume nXi = nX. The same is true for Air.MoistAir,
which declares <strong>final</strong> reducedX = <strong>true</strong>, and always assumes nXi = nX - 1 = 1.</p>
<p>It is also possible to leave reducedX modifiable. In this case, the
BaseProperties model and all additional functions should check for the actual
value of reducedX, and provide the corresponding implementation.</p>

<p>If fixedX is left modifiable, then the implementation should also handle the
case fixedX = true properly.</p>
<p>Fluid connectors should always use composition vectors of size Xi, such as
in the Modelica_Fluid library:</p>
<pre>
<strong>connector</strong> FluidPort
  <strong>replaceable package</strong> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium;
  Medium.AbsolutePressure      p;
  <strong>flow</strong> Medium.MassFlowRate     m_flow;

  Medium.SpecificEnthalpy      h;
  <strong>flow</strong> Medium.EnthalpyFlowRate H_flow;

  Medium.MassFraction          Xi    [Medium.nXi];
  <strong>flow</strong> Medium.MassFlowRate     mX_flow[Medium.nXi];
<strong>end</strong> FluidPort;
</pre>

<a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Media.IdealGases.Common.MixtureGasNasa\">

      end MultipleSubstances;

      class SpecificEnthalpyAsFunction "Specific enthalpy as function"
        extends Modelica.Icons.Information;

        annotation (Documentation(info="<html>
<p>
If pressure p and specific enthalpy h are <strong>not</strong> used as
independent medium variables, the specific enthalpy should
be computed by a Modelica function that has as input arguments
only the independent medium variables. It should <strong>not</strong> be
computed by an equation. For example, if p and T are used
as independent medium variables, a function h_pT(p,T) should
be defined that is called to compute h:
</p>

<pre>
    h = h_pT(p,T);
</pre>

<p>
The reason for this rule requires a longer explanation.
In short, if h is not a computed by a Modelica function and
this function is non-linear in the independent medium variables,
then non-linear systems of equations will occur at
every connection point, if the FluidPort connectors from the
Modelica_Fluid library are used (these are the same as in
Modelica.Media.Examples.Utilities.FluidPort).
Only, if the above rule is fulfilled, a tool is able to
remove these non-linear system of equations in most cases.
</p>

<p>
The basic idea of the FluidPort connector is that 2 or more
components can be connected together at a point and that
automatically the mass and energy balance is fulfilled
in the connection point, i.e., the ideal mixing equations
are generated. Note, the momentum balance is only correct for
straight line connections. If \"ideal mixing\" is not sufficient,
a special component to define the mixing equations must be introduced.
</p>

<p>
The mass and momentum balance equations in a component are
derived from the partial differential equations along the
flow direction of a pipe:
</p>

<p>
<img src=\"modelica://Modelica/Resources/Images/Media/UsersGuide/BalanceEquations1.png\">
</p>

<p>
Note, F<sub>F</sub> is the fanning friction factor.
The energy balance can be given in different forms.
Usually, it is given as:
</p>

<p>
<img src=\"modelica://Modelica/Resources/Images/Media/UsersGuide/EnergyBalance1.png\">
</p>

<p>
This form describes the change of the internal energy, kinetic
energy and potential energy of a volume as function of the
in and out flowing fluid. Multiplying the momentum balance
with the flow velocity v and subtracting it from the energy
balance above, results in the following alternative form
of the energy balance:
</p>

<p>
<img src=\"modelica://Modelica/Resources/Images/Media/UsersGuide/EnergyBalance2.png\">
</p>

<p>
This form has the advantage that the kinetic and potential
energy is no longer part of the energy balance and therefore
the energy balance is substantially simpler (e.g., additional non-linear
systems of equations occur in the first form since the velocity
is present in the energy balance; in the second form this is not
the case and it is still valid also for high speeds).
</p>

<p>
Assume now that the second form of the energy balance above
is used in all components and that the following FluidPort connector
is used in all components:
</p>

<pre>
<strong>connector</strong> FluidPort
  <strong>replaceable package</strong> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium;
  Medium.AbsolutePressure      p;
  <strong>flow</strong> Medium.MassFlowRate     m_flow;

  Medium.SpecificEnthalpy      h;
  <strong>flow</strong> Medium.EnthalpyFlowRate H_flow;

  Medium.MassFraction          Xi    [Medium.nXi];
  <strong>flow</strong> Medium.MassFlowRate     mX_flow[Medium.nXi];
<strong>end</strong> FluidPort;
</pre>

<p>
As an example, assume that 3 components
are connected together and that the medium is a single substance
fluid. This will result in the following
connection equations:
</p>

<pre>
    p1=p2=p3;
    h1=h2=h3;
    0 = m_flow1 + m_flow2 + m_flow3;
    0 = H_flow1 + H_flow2 + H_flow3;
</pre>

<p>
These are the mass balance and the
energy balance (form 2) of an infinitesimal volume
in the connection point under the assumption that no
mass or energy is stored in this volume. In other words,
the connection equations are the equations that describe
ideal mixing. Under the assumption that the velocity
vectors of the 3 flows are identical (especially, they are
parallel), also the momentum balance is fulfilled:
</p>

<pre>
   0 = m_flow1*v1 + m_flow2*v2 + m_flow3*v3;
     = v*(m_flow1 + m_flow2 + m_flow3);
     = 0;
</pre>

<p>
With the above connector it is therefore possible to
connect components together in a nearly arbitrary fashion,
because every connection fulfills automatically the
balance equations. This approach has, however, one drawback:
If two components are connected together, then the medium
variables on both sides of the connector are identical.
However, due to the connector, only the two equations
</p>

<pre>
   p1 = p2;
   h1 = h2;
</pre>

<p>
are present. Assume, that p,T are the independent medium variables
and that the medium properties are computed at one side of the
connections. This means, the following equations are basically
present:
</p>

<pre>
    h1 = h(p1,T1);
    h2 = h(p2,T2);
    p1 = p2;
    h1 = h2;
</pre>

<p>
These equations can be solved in the following way:
</p>

<pre>
    h1 := h(p1,T1)
    p2 := p1;
    h2 := h1;
    0  := h2 - h(p2,T2);   // non-linear system of equations for T2
</pre>

<p>
This means that T2 is computed by solving a non-linear system
of equations. If h1 and h2 are provided as Modelica functions,
a Modelica translator can replace
this non-linear system of equations by the equation:
</p>

<pre>
   T2 := T1;
</pre>

<p>
because after alias substitution there are two function calls
</p>

<pre>
    h1 := h(p1,T1);
    h1 := h(p1,T2);
</pre>

<p>
Since the left hand side of the function call and the first
argument are the same, the second arguments T1 and T2 must also be
identical and therefore T2 := T1. This type of analysis seems
to be only possible, if the specific enthalpy is defined as a function
of the independent medium variables.

<p>
Without pre-caution when implementing a medium model,
it is very easy that non-linear algebraic
systems of equations occur when using the medium model.
In this section it is explained how to avoid non-linear
systems of equations that result from unnecessary
dynamic state selections.
</p>
<p>
A medium model should be implemented in such a way that
a tool is able to select states of a medium in a balance volume
statically (during translation). This is only possible if the
medium equations are written in a specific way. Otherwise,
a tool has to dynamically select states during simulation.
Since medium equations are usually non-linear, this means that
non-linear algebraic systems of equations would occur in every
balance volume.
</p>
<p>
It is assumed that medium equations in a balance volume
are defined in the following way:
</p>
<pre>
    <strong>package</strong> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium;
    Medium.BaseProperties medium;
  <strong>equation</strong>
     // mass balance
       <strong>der</strong>(M)  = port_a.m_flow + port_b.m_flow;
       <strong>der</strong>(MX) = port_a_mX_flow + port_b_mX_flow;
             M = V*medium.d;
            MX = M*medium.X;

     // Energy balance
     U = M*medium.u;
     <strong>der</strong>(U) = port_a.H_flow+port_b.H_flow;
</pre>
<p>
<strong>Single Substance Media</strong>
</p>
<p>
A medium consisting of a single substance
has to define two of \"p,T,d,u,h\" with
stateSelect=StateSelect.prefer if BaseProperties.preferredMediumstates = <strong>true</strong>
and has to provide the other three variables as function of these
states. This results in:
</p>
<ul>
<li> static state selection (no dynamic choices).</li>
<li> a linear system of equations in the two
     state derivatives.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Example for a single substance medium</strong>
</p>
<p>
p, T are preferred states (i.e., StateSelect.prefer is set)
and there are three equations written in the form:
</p>
<pre>
   d = fd(p,T)
   u = fu(p,T)
   h = fh(p,T)
</pre>
<p>
Index reduction leads to the equations:
</p>
<pre>
   <strong>der</strong>(M) = V*<strong>der</strong>(d)
   <strong>der</strong>(U) = <strong>der</strong>(M)*u + M*<strong>der</strong>(u)
   <strong>der</strong>(d) = <strong>der</strong>(fd,p)*<strong>der</strong>(p) + <strong>der</strong>(fd,T)*<strong>der</strong>(T)
   <strong>der</strong>(u) = <strong>der</strong>(fu,p)*<strong>der</strong>(p) + <strong>der</strong>(fu,T)*<strong>der</strong>(T)
</pre>
<p>
Note, that <strong>der</strong>(y,x) is the partial derivative of y with respect to x
and that this operator will be introduced in a future version
of the Modelica language.
The above equations imply, that if p,T are provided from the
integrator as states, all functions, such as fd(p,T)
or <strong>der</strong>(fd,p) can be evaluated as function of the states.
The overall system results in a linear system
of equations in <strong>der</strong>(p) and <strong>der</strong>(T) after eliminating
<strong>der</strong>(M), <strong>der</strong>(U), <strong>der</strong>(d), <strong>der</strong>(u) via tearing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Counter Example for a single substance medium</strong>
</p>
<p>
An ideal gas with one substance is written in the form
</p>
<pre>
  <strong>redeclare model extends</strong> BaseProperties(
     T(stateSelect=if preferredMediumStates then StateSelect.prefer else StateSelect.default),
     p(stateSelect=if preferredMediumStates then StateSelect.prefer else StateSelect.default)
  <strong>equation</strong>
     h = h(T);
     u = h - R*T;
     p = d*R*T;
      ...
  <strong>end</strong> BaseProperties;
</pre>
<p>
If p, T are preferred states, these equations are <strong>not</strong>
written in the recommended form, because d is not a
function of p and T. If p,T would be states, it would be
necessary to solve for the density:
</p>
<pre>
   d = p/(R*T)
</pre>
<p>
If T or R are zero, this results in a division by zero.
A tool does not know that R or T cannot become zero.
Therefore, a tool must assume that p, T <strong>cannot</strong> always be
selected as states and has to either use another static
state selection or use dynamic state selection. The only
other choice for static state selection is d,T, because
h,u,p are given as functions of d,T.
However, as potential states only variables appearing differentiated and variables
declared with StateSelect.prefer or StateSelect.always
are used. Since \"d\" does not appear differentiated and has
StateSelect.default, it cannot be selected as a state.
As a result, the tool has to select states dynamically
during simulation. Since the equations above are non-linear
and they are utilized in the dynamic state
selection, a non-linear system of equations is present
in every balance volume.
</p>
<p>
To summarize, for single substance ideal gas media there
are the following two possibilities to get static
state selection and linear systems of equations:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Use p,T as preferred states and write the equation
     for d in the form: d = p/(T*R)</li>
<li> Use d,T as preferred states and write the equation
     for p in the form: p = d*T*R</li>
</ol>

All other settings (other/no preferred states etc.) lead
to dynamic state selection and non-linear systems of
equations for a balance volume.

<p>
<strong>Multiple Substance Media</strong>
</p>
<p>
A medium consisting of multiple substance
has to define two of \"p,T,d,u,h\" as well
as the mass fractions Xi with
stateSelect=StateSelect.prefer (if BaseProperties.preferredMediumStates = <strong>true</strong>)
and has to provide
the other three variables as functions of these
states. Only then, static selection is possible
for a tool.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Example for a multiple substance medium:</strong>
</p>
<p>
p, T and Xi are defined as preferred states and
the equations are written in the form:
</p>
<pre>
   d = fp(p,T,Xi);
   u = fu(p,T,Xi);
   h = fh(p,T,Xi);
</pre>
<p>
Since the balance equations are written in the form:
</p>
<pre>
              M = V*medium.d;
            MXi = M*medium.Xi;
</pre>
<p>
The variables M and MXi appearing differentiated in the
balance equations are provided as functions of d and Xi
and since d is given as a function of p, T and Xi, it
is possible to compute M and MXi directly from the desired
states. This means that static state selection is possible.

<p>
After implementation of a new medium model, it should
be tested. A basic test is already provided with model
Modelica.Media.Examples.Utilities.PartialTestModel
which might be used in the following way:
</p>

<pre>
  <strong>model</strong> TestOfMyMedium
     <strong>extends</strong> Modelica.Media.Examples.Utilities.PartialTestModel(
              <strong>redeclare package</strong> Medium = MyMedium);
  <strong>end</strong> TestOfMyMedium;
</pre>

<p>
It might be necessary to adapt or change initial values
depending on the validity range of the medium.
The model above should translate and simulate.
If the medium model is written according to the
suggestions given in the previous sections (and the Modelica
translator has appropriate algorithms implemented),
there should be only static state selection everywhere
and no non-linear system of equations, provided h is an independent
medium variable or is only a function of T. If h is a function
of, say h=h(p,T), one non-linear system of equations occurs that
cannot be avoided.
</p>

<p>
The test model above can be used to test the most basic
properties. Of course, more tests should be performed.

</p>
<ul>
<li> The essential parts of the media models have been implemented
     in the ThermoFluid library by Hubertus Tummescheit with
     help from Jonas Eborn and Falko Jens Wagner. These media models
     have been converted to the Modelica.Media interface definition
     and have been improved by Hubertus Tummescheit.</li>
<li> The effort for the development of the Modelica.Media library has been
     organized by Martin Otter who also contributed to the design,
     implemented part of the generic models, contributed to the User's Guide
     and provided the generic test suite Modelica.Media.Examples.Tests.</li>

<p>
Library <strong>Modelica.Media</strong> is a <strong>free</strong> Modelica package providing
a standardized interface to fluid media models and specific
media models based on this interface.
A fluid medium model defines <strong>algebraic</strong> equations
for the intensive thermodynamic variables used in the <strong>mass</strong>
and <strong>energy</strong> balance of component models. Optionally, additional
medium properties can be computed such as dynamic viscosity or thermal
conductivity. Medium models are defined for <strong>single</strong> and
<strong>multiple substance</strong> fluids with <strong>one</strong> and
<strong>multiple phases</strong>.
</p>
<p>
A large part of the library provides specific medium models
that can be directly utilized. This library can be used in
all types of Modelica fluid libraries that may have different connectors
and design philosophies. It is particularly utilized
in the Modelica_Fluid library (the Modelica_Fluid library is currently
under development to provide 1D therm-fluid flow components for
single and multiple substance flow with one and multiple phases).
The Modelica.Media library has the following
main features:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Balance equations and media model equations
     are decoupled.
     This means that the used medium model does usually not have an
     influence on how the balance equations are formulated.
     For example, the same balance equations are used for media
     that use pressure and temperature, or pressure and specific
     enthalpy as independent variables, as well as for
     incompressible and compressible media models.
     A Modelica tool will have enough information to
     generate as efficient code as a traditional
     (coupled) definition. This feature is described in more
     detail in section
     <a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Media.UsersGuide.MediumDefinition.StaticStateSelection\">Static State Selection</a>.</li>
<li> Optional variables, such as dynamic viscosity, are only computed if
     needed in the corresponding component.</li>
<li> The independent variables of a medium model do not
     influence the definition of a fluid connector port.
     Especially, the media models are implemented in such a way
     that a connector may have the minimum number of independent
     medium variables in a connector and still get the same
     efficiency as if all medium variables are passed by the
     connector from one component to the next one (the latter
     approach has the restriction that a fluid port can only
     connect two components and not more). Note, the Modelica_Fluid
     library uses the first approach, i.e., having a set of
     independent medium variables in a connector.</li>
<li> The medium models are implemented with regards to
     efficient dynamic simulation. For example, two phase
     medium models trigger state events at phase boundaries
     (because the medium variables are not differentiable
     at this point).</li>
</ul>
<p>

</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Media.UsersGuide.MediumUsage\">Medium usage</a>
     describes how to use a medium model from
     this library in a component model.</li>

<p>This model produces psychrometric data from the moist air model in this library to be plotted in charts. The two most common chart varieties are the Mollier Diagram and the Psychrometric Chart. The first is widely used in some European countries while the second is more common in the Anglo-American world. Specific enthalpy is plotted over absolute humidity in the Mollier Diagram, it is the other way round in the Psychrometric Chart.<br>
It must be noted that the relationship of both axis variables is not right-angled, the absolute humidity follows a slope which equals the enthalpy of vaporization at 0 &deg;C. For better reading and in order to reduce the fog region the humidity axis is rotated to obtain a right-angled plot. Both charts usually contain additional information as isochores or auxiliary scales for e.g., heat ratios. Those information are omitted in this model and the charts below. Other important features of psychrometric chart data are that all mass specific variables (like absolute humidity, specific enthalpy etc.) are expressed in terms of kg dry air and that their baseline of 0 enthalpy is found at 0 &deg;C and zero humidity.</p>

<h4>Example: TwoPhaseWater</h4>
The TwoPhaseWater package demonstrates how to extend the parsimonious
BaseProperties with a minimal set of properties from the standard water
package with most properties that are needed in two-phase situations.
The model also demonstrates how to compute additional&nbsp; properties
for the medium model. In this scenario, that builds a new medium model
with many more properties than the default, the standard BaseProperties
is used as a basis. For additional properties, a user has to:<br>
<ol>
<li>Declare a new variable of the wanted type, e.g., \"<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 255);\">DynamicViscosity
eta</span>\".</li>
<li>Compute that variable by calling the function form the package,
e.g., <span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 255);\">eta =
dynamicViscosity(state)</span>. Note that the instance of
ThermodynamicState is used as an input to the function. This instance
\"state\" is declared in PartialMedium and thus available in every medium
model. A user does not have to know what actual variables are required
to compute the dynamic viscosity, because the state instance is
guaranteed to contain what is needed.</li>
<li><span style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">Attention</span>: Many
properties are not well defined in the two phase region and the
functions might return undesired values if called there. It is the
user's responsibility&nbsp; to take care of such situations. The example
uses one of several possible models to compute an averaged viscosity
for two-phase flows.</li>
</ol>
In two phase models, properties are often needed on the phase boundary
just outside the two phase dome, right on the border.. To compute the
thermodynamic state there, two auxiliary functions are provided: <strong>setDewState(sat)</strong> and <strong>setBubbleState(sat)</strong>. They take an
instance of SaturationProperties as input. By default they are in
one-phase, but with the optional phase argument set to 2, the output is
forced to be just inside the phase boundary. This is only needed when
derivatives like cv are computed with are different on both sides of
the boundaries. The usual steps to compute properties on the phase
boundary are:<br>
<ol>
<li>Declare an instance of ThermodynamicState, e.g., \"ThermodynamicState&nbsp; dew\".</li>
<li>Compute the state, using an instance of SaturationProperties,
e.g., dew = setDewState(sat)</li>
<li>Compute properties on the phase boundary to your full desire,
e.g., \"cp_d = specificHeatCapacityCp(dew)\".<br>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The sample model TestTwoPhaseStates test the extended properties</p>

<p>
The same procedure can be used to compute properties at other state
points, e.g., when an isentropic reference state is computed.

<p>
This component models the <strong>volume</strong> of <strong>fixed size</strong> that is
associated with the <strong>fluid port</strong> to which it is connected.
This means that all medium properties inside the volume, are identical
to the port medium properties. In particular, the specific enthalpy
inside the volume (= medium.h) is always identical to the specific enthalpy
in the port (port.h = medium.h). Usually, this model is used when
discretizing a component according to the finite volume method into
volumes in internal ports that only store energy and mass and into
transport elements that just transport energy, mass and momentum
between the internal ports without storing these quantities during the
transport.

<p>
This component models the <strong>volume</strong> of <strong>fixed size</strong> that is
associated with the <strong>fluid port</strong> to which it is connected.
This means that all medium properties inside the volume, are identical
to the port medium properties. In particular, the specific enthalpy
inside the volume (= medium.h) is always identical to the specific enthalpy
in the port (port.h = medium.h). Usually, this model is used when
discretizing a component according to the finite volume method into
volumes in internal ports that only store energy and mass and into
transport elements that just transport energy, mass and momentum
between the internal ports without storing these quantities during the
transport.

<h4>Examples</h4>
Physical properties for fluids are needed in so many different variants
that a library can only provide models for the most common situations.
With the following examples we are going to demonstrate how to use the
existing packages and functions in Modelica.Media to customize these
models for advanced applications. The high level functions try to
abstract as much as possible form the fact that different media are
based on different variables, e.g., ideal gases need pressure and
temperature, while many refrigerants are based on Helmholtz functions
of density and temperature, and many water properties are based on
pressure and specific enthalpy. Medium properties are needed in control
volumes in the dynamic state equations and in many thermodynamic state
locations that are independent of the dynamic states of a control
volume, e.g., at a wall temperature, an isentropic reference state or at
a phase boundary. The general structure of the library is such that:<br>
<ul>
<li>Each medium has a model called BaseProperties. BaseProperties
contains the minimum set of medium properties needed in a dynamic
control volume model.</li>
<li>Each instance of BaseProperties contains a \"state\" record that is
an input to all the functions to compute properties. If these functions
need further inputs, like e.g., the molarMass, these are accessible as
constants in the package.</li>
<li>The simplest way to compute properties at any other reference
point is to declare an instance of ThermodynamicState and use that as
input to arbitrary property functions.<br>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
A small library of generic volume, pipe, pump and ambient models
is provided in Modelica.Media.Examples.Tests.Components to demonstrate
how fluid components should be implemented that are using Modelica.Media
models. This library is also used to test all media models in
Modelica.Media.Examples.Tests.MediaTestModels.

         on a thermal variable (temperature or enthalpy). Otherwise, set it

         no need to bother about medium compositions at all. Otherwise, set

         Medium types, defined in the base class Interfaces.PartialMedium

In order to implement an actual medium model, one can extend from this
base model and add <strong>5 equations</strong> that provide relations among
these variables. Equations will also have to be added in order to
set all the variables within the ThermodynamicState record state.</p>
<p>
If standardOrderComponents=true, the full composition vector X[nX]
is determined by the equations contained in this base class, depending
on the independent mass fraction vector Xi[nXi].</p>
<p>Additional <strong>2 + nXi</strong> equations will have to be provided
when using the BaseProperties model, in order to fully specify the
thermodynamic conditions. The input connector qualifier applied to
p, h, and nXi indirectly declares the number of missing equations,
permitting advanced equation balance checking by Modelica tools.
Please note that this doesn't mean that the additional equations
should be connection equations, nor that exactly those variables
should be supplied, in order to complete the model.

Section 4.7 (Balanced Models) of the Modelica 3.0 specification.</p>

<h4>Linear Compressibility Fluid Model</h4>
<p>This linear compressibility fluid model is based on the assumptions that:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The specific heat capacity at constant pressure (cp) is constant</li>
<li>The isobaric expansion coefficient (beta) is constant</li>
<li>The isothermal compressibility (kappa) is constant</li>
<li>Pressure and temperature are used as states</li>
<li>The influence of density on specific enthalpy (h), entropy (s), inner energy (u) and heat capacity (cv) at constant volume is neglected.</li>
</ul>
<p>
That means that the density is a linear function in temperature and in pressure.
In order to define the complete model, a number of constant reference values are needed which
are computed at the reference values of the states pressure p and temperature T. The model can
be interpreted as a linearization of a full non-linear fluid model (but it is not linear in all
thermodynamic coordinates). Reference values are needed for
</p>
<ol>
<li>the density (reference_d),</li>
<li>the specific enthalpy (reference_h),</li>
<li>the specific entropy (reference_s).</li>
</ol>
<p>
Apart from that, a user needs to define the molar mass, MM_const.
Note that it is possible to define a fluid by computing the reference
values from a full non-linear fluid model by computing the package constants
using the standard functions defined in a fluid package (see example in liquids package).
</p>
<p>
In order to avoid numerical inversion of the temperature in the T_ph and T_ps functions, the density
is always taken to be the reference density in the computation of h, s, u and cv. For liquids (and this
model is intended only for liquids) the relative error of doing so is 1e-3 to 1e-4 at most. The model would
be more \"correct\" based on the other assumptions, if occurrences of reference_d in the computations of h,s,u
and cv would be replaced by a call to density(state). That would require a numerical solution for T_ps, while T_ph can be solved symbolically from a quadratic function. Errors from this approximation are small because liquid density varies little.</p>
<h4>Efficiency considerations</h4>
<p>One of the main reasons to use a simple, linear fluid model is to achieve high performance
in simulations. There are a number of possible compromises and possibilities to improve performance.
Some of them can be influenced by a flag. The following rules where used in this model:</p>
<ul>
<li>All forward evaluations (using the ThermodynamicState record as input) are exactly following
the assumptions above.</li>
<li>If the flag <strong>constantJacobian</strong> is set to true in the package, all functions that
typically appear in thermodynamic Jacobians (specificHeatCapacityCv, density_derp_h, density_derh_p,
density_derp_T, density_derT_p) are evaluated at reference conditions (that means using the reference
density) instead of the density of the current pressure and temperature. This makes it possible to evaluate
the thermodynamic Jacobian at compile time.</li>
<li>For inverse functions using other inputs than the states (e.g pressure p and specific enthalpy h),
the inversion is using the reference state whenever that is necessary to achieve a symbolic inversion.</li>
<li>If <strong>constantJacobian</strong> is set to false, the above list of functions is computed exactly according
to the above list of assumptions</li>

<p>
Important: the phase equilibrium conditions are not yet considered.
this means that Bridgman's tables do not yet work in the two phase region.
Some derivatives are 0 or infinity anyways.
Idea: Do not use the values in Bridgmans table directly, all
derivatives are calculated as the quotient of two entries in the
table. The last letter indicates which variable is held constant in
taking the derivative. The second letters are the two variables
involved in the derivative and the first letter is always a d to remind
of differentiation.
</p>

<pre>
Example 1: Get the derivative of specific entropy s w.r.t. Temperature at
constant specific volume (between identical to constant density)
constant volume  --> last letter v
Temperature      --> second letter T
Specific entropy --> second letter s
--> the needed value is dsv/dTv
Known variables:
Temperature T
pressure p
specific volume v
specific inner energy u
specific enthalpy h
specific entropy s
specific Helmholtz energy f
specific gibbs enthalpy g
Not included but useful:
density d
In order to convert derivatives involving density use the following
rules:
at constant density == at constant specific volume
ddx/dyx = -d*d*dvx/dyx with y,x any of T,p,u,h,s,f,g
dyx/ddx = -1/(d*d)dyx/dvx with y,x any of T,p,u,h,s,f,g

This function is used to approximate the equation
</p>
<pre>
    y = <strong>if</strong> x &gt; 0 <strong>then</strong> y1 <strong>else</strong> y2;
</pre>

<p>
by a smooth characteristic, so that the expression is continuous and differentiable:
</p>

<pre>
   y = <strong>smooth</strong>(1, <strong>if</strong> x &gt;  x_small <strong>then</strong> y1 <strong>else</strong>
                 <strong>if</strong> x &lt; -x_small <strong>then</strong> y2 <strong>else</strong> f(y1, y2));
</pre>

<p>
In the region -x_small &lt; x &lt; x_small a 2nd order polynomial is used
for a smooth transition from y1 to y2.
</p>

<p>
If <strong>mass fractions</strong> X[:] are approximated with this function then this can be performed
for all <strong>nX</strong> mass fractions, instead of applying it for nX-1 mass fractions and computing
the last one by the mass fraction constraint sum(X)=1. The reason is that the approximating function has the
property that sum(X) = 1, provided sum(X_a) = sum(X_b) = 1
(and y1=X_a[i], y2=X_b[i]).
This can be shown by evaluating the approximating function in the abs(x) &lt; x_small
region (otherwise X is either X_a or X_b):
</p>

<pre>
    X[1]  = smoothStep(x, X_a[1] , X_b[1] , x_small);
    X[2]  = smoothStep(x, X_a[2] , X_b[2] , x_small);
       ...
    X[nX] = smoothStep(x, X_a[nX], X_b[nX], x_small);
</pre>

<p>
or
</p>

<pre>
    X[1]  = c*(X_a[1]  - X_b[1])  + (X_a[1]  + X_b[1])/2
    X[2]  = c*(X_a[2]  - X_b[2])  + (X_a[2]  + X_b[2])/2;
       ...
    X[nX] = c*(X_a[nX] - X_b[nX]) + (X_a[nX] + X_b[nX])/2;
    c     = (x/x_small)*((x/x_small)^2 - 3)/4
</pre>

<p>
Summing all mass fractions together results in
</p>

<pre>
    sum(X) = c*(sum(X_a) - sum(X_b)) + (sum(X_a) + sum(X_b))/2

           = 1

This function should currently only be used in Modelica.Media,

where the tool is responsible for the solution of the non-linear
equation.
</p>

<p>
This library determines the solution of one non-linear algebraic equation \"y=f(x)\"
in one unknown \"x\" in a reliable way. As input, the desired value y of the
non-linear function has to be given, as well as an interval x_min, x_max that
contains the solution, i.e., \"f(x_min) - y\" and \"f(x_max) - y\" must
have a different sign. If possible, a smaller interval is computed by
inverse quadratic interpolation (interpolating with a quadratic polynomial
through the last 3 points and computing the zero). If this fails,
bisection is used, which always reduces the interval by a factor of 2.
The inverse quadratic interpolation method has superlinear convergence.
This is roughly the same convergence rate as a globally convergent Newton
method, but without the need to compute derivatives of the non-linear
function. The solver function is a direct mapping of the Algol 60 procedure
\"zero\" to Modelica, from:

Due to current limitations of the
Modelica language (not possible to pass a function reference to a function),
the construction to use this solver on a user-defined function is a bit
complicated (this method is from Hans Olsson, Dassault Syst&egrave;mes AB). A user has to
provide a package in the following way:

This model calculates medium properties
for air in the <strong>liquid</strong>, <strong>gas</strong> and <strong>two phase</strong> regions.
Three variable pairs can be the independent variables of the model:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Pressure <strong>p</strong> and specific enthalpy <strong>h</strong> are the most natural choice for general applications. This is the recommended choice for most general purpose applications.</li>
<li>Pressure <strong>p</strong> and temperature <strong>T</strong> are the most natural choice for applications where air is always in the same phase (liquid or gas).</li>
<li>Density <strong>d</strong> and temperature <strong>T</strong> are explicit variables of the Helmholtz function in the near-critical region and can be the best choice for applications with super-critical or near-critical states.</li>
</ol>

The following quantities are always computed:

<p>This model computes thermodynamic properties of moist air from three independent (thermodynamic or/and numerical) state variables. Preferred numerical states are temperature T, pressure p and the reduced composition vector Xi, which contains the water mass fraction only. As an EOS the <strong>ideal gas law</strong> is used and associated restrictions apply. The model can also be used in the <strong>fog region</strong>, when moisture is present in its liquid state. However, it is assumed that the liquid water volume is negligible compared to that of the gas phase. Computation of thermal properties is based on property data of <a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Media.Air.DryAirNasa\"> dry air</a> and water (source: VDI-W&auml;rmeatlas), respectively. Besides the standard thermodynamic variables <strong>absolute and relative humidity</strong>, x_water and phi, respectively, are given by the model. Upper case X denotes absolute humidity with respect to mass of moist air while absolute humidity with respect to mass of dry air only is denoted by a lower case x throughout the model.

<h4>Thermodynamic Model</h4>
<p>This package provides a full thermodynamic model of moist air including the fog region and temperatures below zero degC.
The governing assumptions in this model are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the perfect gas law applies</li>
<li>water volume other than that of steam is neglected</li></ul>
<p>All extensive properties are expressed in terms of the total mass in order to comply with other media in this library. However, for moist air it is rather common to express the absolute humidity in terms of mass of dry air only, which has advantages when working with charts. In addition, care must be taken, when working with mass fractions with respect to total mass, that all properties refer to the same water content when being used in mathematical operations (which is always the case if based on dry air only). Therefore two absolute humidities are computed in the <strong>BaseProperties</strong> model: <strong>X</strong> denotes the absolute humidity in terms of the total mass while <strong>x</strong> denotes the absolute humidity per unit mass of dry air. In addition, the relative humidity <strong>phi</strong> is also computed.</p>
<p>At the triple point temperature of water of 0.01 &deg;C or 273.16 K and a relative humidity greater than 1 fog may be present as liquid and as ice resulting in a specific enthalpy somewhere between those of the two isotherms for solid and liquid fog, respectively. For numerical reasons a coexisting mixture of 50% solid and 50% liquid fog is assumed in the fog region at the triple point in this model.</p>

<h4>Range of validity</h4>
<p>From the assumptions mentioned above it follows that the <strong>pressure</strong> should be in the region around <strong>atmospheric</strong> conditions or below (a few bars may still be fine though). Additionally a very high water content at low temperatures would yield incorrect densities, because the volume of the liquid or solid phase would not be negligible anymore. The model does not provide information on limits for water drop size in the fog region or transport information for the actual condensation or evaporation process in combination with surfaces. All excess water which is not in its vapour state is assumed to be still present in the air regarding its energy but not in terms of its spatial extent.<br><br>
The thermodynamic model may be used for <strong>temperatures</strong> ranging from <strong>190 ... 647 K</strong>. This holds for all functions unless otherwise stated in their description. However, although the model works at temperatures above the saturation temperature it is questionable to use the term \"relative humidity\" in this region. Please note, that although several functions compute pure water properties, they are designed to be used within the moist air medium model where properties are dominated by air and steam in their vapor states, and not for pure liquid water applications.</p>

<h4>Transport Properties</h4>
<p>Several additional functions that are not needed to describe the thermodynamic system, but are required to model transport processes, like heat and mass transfer, may be called. They usually neglect the moisture influence unless otherwise stated.</p>

<h4>Application</h4>
<p>The model's main area of application is all processes that involve moist air cooling under near atmospheric pressure with possible moisture condensation. This is the case in all domestic and industrial air conditioning applications. Another large domain of moist air applications covers all processes that deal with dehydration of bulk material using air as a transport medium. Engineering tasks involving moist air are often performed (or at least visualized) by using charts that contain all relevant thermodynamic data for a moist air system. These so called psychrometric charts can be generated from the medium properties in this package. The model <a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Media.Examples.PsychrometricData\">PsychrometricData</a> may be used for this purpose in order to obtain data for figures like those below (the plotting itself is not part of the model though).</p>

Calculation of fluid properties for moist air in the region from 143.15 Kelvin to 2000 Kelvin at pressures up to 10 MPa. This model of moist air is based on
the diploma thesis of Hellriegel [10] with small modifications. Moist air is treated as an ideal mixture of the real fluids air and water.
</p>

<h4>Restriction</h4>
<p>
The functions provided by this package shall be used inside of the restricted limits according to the referenced literature.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>611.2 Pa &le; p &le; 10 MPa</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>143.15 K &le; T &le; 2000 K</strong>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Usage</h4>
<p>
The package MoistAir can be used as any other medium model (see <a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Media.UsersGuide\">User's Guide of Media Library</a> for further information). The package defines two boolean constants <strong>useEnhancementFactor</strong> and <strong>useDissociation</strong>, which give the user fine grained control of the calculations.
</p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2>
<tr>
<td><strong>Constant</strong></td>
<td><strong>Default Value</strong></td>
<td><strong>Meaning</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>useEnhancementFactor</td>
<td>false</td>
<td>The enhancement factor is used in the calculation of the saturation partial pressure of water in moist air. It is always very close to 1 except for high pressures (&gt;2 MPa) and low temperatures (&lt;233.15 K). For pressures less than 1 MPa this factor can be safely set to 1. Its calculation is very expensive, since it can only be calculated by an iterative method.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>useDissociation</td>
<td>true</td>
<td>The effect of dissociation is taken into account for temperatures greater than 773.15 K.</td>

<h5>Saturation pressure of water in moist air</h5>
<p>
The saturation pressure p<sub>ds</sub> of water in moist air is calculated by p<sub>ds</sub> = f*p<sub>sat</sub>, where
</p>

<ul>
<li>f is the enhancement factor from [9] and [3]</li>
<li>p<sub>sat</sub> for T &ge; 273.16 K is the saturation pressure from [4]</li>
<li>p<sub>sat</sub> for T &lt; 273.16 K is the saturation pressure from [8]</li>
</ul>


<h5>Dissociation</h5>
<p>
For temperatures above 773.15 K effects of dissociation are taken into account. Dissociation is modeled according to [11].
For high temperatures the calculated values for moist air with 0 kg(water)/kg(dry air) (i.e. dry air) may differ from those
calculated by the package Modelica.Media.Air.ReferenceAir, because there no dissociation is considered.

<h4>Fluid models with linear compressibility, using PartialLinearFluid as base class.</h4>
<p>The linear compressibility fluid models contained in this package are based on the assumptions that:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The specific heat capacity at constant pressure (cp) is constant</li>
<li>The isobaric expansion coefficient (beta) is constant</li>
<li>The isothermal compressibility (kappa) is constant</li>
<li>Pressure and temperature are used as states</li>
</ul>
<p>
This results in models that are only valid for small temperature ranges, but sufficient to model compressibility and e.g., the \"water hammer\" effect. Another advantage id that only 3 values need to be measured to have an initial model. Hydraulic fluids can often be approximated by this type of model.
</p>
<p>
That means that the density is a linear function in temperature and in pressure.
In order to define the complete model, a number of constant reference values are needed which
are computed at the reference values of the states pressure p and temperature T. The model can
be interpreted as a linearization of a full non-linear fluid model (but it is not linear in all
thermodynamic coordinates). Reference values are needed for
</p>
<ol>
<li>the density (reference_d),</li>
<li>the specific enthalpy (reference_h),</li>
<li>the specific entropy (reference_s).</li>
</ol>
<p>
Apart from that, a user needs to define the molar mass, MM_const.
Note that it is possible to define a fluid by computing the reference
values from a full non-linear fluid model by computing the package constants
using the standard functions defined in a fluid package (see example in Common, LinearWater_pT).

The used formula are based on the method of Chung et al (1984, 1988) referred to in ref [1] chapter 9.
The formula 9-4.10 is the one being used. The Formula is given in non-SI units, the following conversion constants were used to
transform the formula to SI units:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <strong>Const1_SI:</strong> The factor 10^(-9.5) =10^(-2.5)*1e-7 where the
     factor 10^(-2.5) originates from the conversion of g/mol->kg/mol + cm^3/mol->m^3/mol
      and the factor 1e-7 is due to conversion from microPoise->Pa.s.</li>
<li>  <strong>Const2_SI:</strong> The factor 1/3.335641e-27 = 1e-3/3.335641e-30
      where the factor 3.335641e-30 comes from debye->C.m and

This function provides two similar methods for estimating the
thermal conductivity of polyatomic gases.
The Eucken method (input method == 1) gives good results for low temperatures,
but it tends to give an underestimated value of the thermal conductivity
(lambda) at higher temperatures.<br>
The Modified Eucken method (input method == 2) gives good results for
high-temperatures, but it tends to give an overestimated value of the
thermal conductivity (lambda) at low temperatures.

The used formula are based on the method of Chung et al (1984, 1988) referred to in ref [1] chapter 9.
The formula 9-4.10 is the one being used. The Formula is given in non-SI units, the following conversion constants were used to
transform the formula to SI units:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <strong>Const1_SI:</strong> The factor 10^(-9.5) =10^(-2.5)*1e-7 where the
     factor 10^(-2.5) originates from the conversion of g/mol->kg/mol + cm^3/mol->m^3/mol
      and the factor 1e-7 is due to conversion from microPoise->Pa.s.</li>
<li>  <strong>Const2_SI:</strong> The factor 1/3.335641e-27 = 1e-3/3.335641e-30
      where the factor 3.335641e-30 comes from debye->C.m and

This function provides two similar methods for estimating the
thermal conductivity of polyatomic gases.
The Eucken method (input method == 1) gives good results for low temperatures,
but it tends to give an underestimated value of the thermal conductivity
(lambda) at higher temperatures.<br>
The Modified Eucken method (input method == 2) gives good results for
high-temperatures, but it tends to give an overestimated value of the
thermal conductivity (lambda) at low temperatures.

This model calculates medium properties
for an ideal gas of a single substance, or for an ideal
gas consisting of several substances where the
mass fractions are fixed. Independent variables
are temperature <strong>T</strong> and pressure <strong>p</strong>.
Only density is a function of T and p. All other quantities
are solely a function of T. The properties
are valid in the range:

<p>
Simplification of the kinetic theory (Chapman and Enskog theory)
approach neglecting the second-order effects.<br>
<br>
This equation has been extensively tested (Amdur and Mason, 1958;
Bromley and Wilke, 1951; Cheung, 1958; Dahler, 1959; Gandhi and Saxena,
1964; Ranz and Brodowsky, 1962; Saxena and Gambhir, 1963a; Strunk, et
al., 1964; Vanderslice, et al. 1962; Wright and Gray, 1962). In most
cases, only nonpolar mixtures were compared, and very good results
obtained. For some systems containing hydrogen as one component, less
satisfactory agreement was noted. Wilke's method predicted mixture
viscosities that were larger than experimental for the H2-N2 system,
but for H2-NH3, it underestimated the viscosities.<br>
Gururaja, et al. (1967) found that this method also overpredicted in
the H2-O2 case but was quite accurate for the H2-CO2 system.<br>
Wilke's approximation has proved reliable even for polar-polar gas
mixtures of aliphatic alcohols (Reid and Belenyessy, 1960). The
principal reservation appears to lie in those cases where Mi&gt;&gt;Mj

Equation to estimate the viscosity of gas mixtures at low pressures.<br>
It is a simplification of an extension of the rigorous kinetic theory
of Chapman and Enskog to determine the viscosity of multicomponent
mixtures, at low pressures and with a factor to correct for molecule
shape and polarity.

<p>
The input argument Kappa is a special correction for highly polar substances such as
alcohols and acids.<br>

This function applies the Masson and Saxena modification of the
Wassiljewa Equation for the thermal conductivity for gas mixtures of
n elements at low pressure.
</p>

<p>
For nonpolar gas mixtures errors will generally be less than 3 to 4%.
For mixtures of nonpolar-polar and polar-polar gases, errors greater
than 5 to 8% may be expected. For mixtures in which the sizes and
polarities of the constituent molecules are not greatly different, the
thermal conductivity can be estimated satisfactorily by a mole fraction
average of the pure component conductivities.

</blockquote>
<p>Medium models for some of these gases are available in package
<a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Media.IdealGases.SingleGases\">IdealGases.SingleGases</a>
and some examples for mixtures are available in package <a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Media.IdealGases.MixtureGases\">IdealGases.MixtureGases</a>
</p>
<h4>Using and Adapting Medium Models</h4>
<p>
The data records allow computing the ideal gas specific enthalpy, specific entropy and heat capacity of the substances listed below. From them, even the Gibbs energy and equilibrium constants for reactions can be computed. Critical data that is needed for computing the viscosity and thermal conductivity is not included. In order to add mixtures or single substance medium packages that are
subtypes of
<a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium\">Interfaces.PartialMedium</a>
(i.e., can be utilized at all places where PartialMedium is defined),
a few additional steps have to be performed:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
All single gas media need to define a constant instance of record
<a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium.FluidConstants\">IdealGases.Common.SingleGasNasa.FluidConstants</a>.
For 37 ideal gases such records are provided in package
<a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Media.IdealGases.Common.FluidData\">IdealGases.Common.FluidData</a>.
For the other gases, such a record instance has to be provided by the user, e.g., by getting
the data from a commercial or public data base. A public source of the needed data is for example the <a href=\"http://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/\"> NIST Chemistry WebBook</a></li>

<li>When the data is available, and a user has an instance of a
<a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium.FluidConstants\">FluidConstants</a> record filled with data, a medium package has to be written. Note that only the dipole moment, the acentric factor and critical data are necessary for the viscosity and thermal conductivity functions.</li>
<li><ul>
<li>For single components, a new package following the pattern in
<a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Media.IdealGases.SingleGases\">IdealGases.SingleGases</a> has to be created, pointing both to a data record for cp and to a user-defined fluidConstants record.</li>
<li>For mixtures of several components, a new package following the pattern in
<a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Media.IdealGases.MixtureGases\">IdealGases.MixtureGases</a> has to be created, building an array of data records for cp and an array of (partly) user-defined fluidConstants records.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Note that many properties can computed for the full set of 1241 gases listed below, but due to the missing viscosity and thermal conductivity functions, no fully Modelica.Media-compliant media can be defined.</p>
<p>
Data records for heat capacity, specific enthalpy and specific entropy exist for the following substances and ions:

<p>
Note that the inner energy neglects the pressure dependence, which is only
true for an incompressible medium with d = constant. The neglected term is
p-reference_p)/rho*(T/rho)*(partial rho /partial T). This is very small for
liquids due to proportionality to 1/d^2, but can be problematic for gases that are
modeled incompressible.
</p>
<p>It should be noted that incompressible media only have 1 state per control volume (usually T),
but have both T and p as inputs for fully correct properties. The error of using only T-dependent
properties is small, therefore a Boolean flag enthalpyOfT exists. If it is true, the
enumeration Choices.independentVariables  is set to  Choices.independentVariables.T otherwise
it is set to Choices.independentVariables.pT.</p>
<p>
Enthalpy is never a function of T only (h = h(T) + (p-reference_p)/d), but the
error is also small and non-linear systems can be avoided. In particular,
non-linear systems are small and local as opposed to large and over all volumes.

<p>
Entropy is calculated as
</p>

  s = s0 + integral(Cp(T)/T,dt)

which is only exactly true for a fluid with constant density d=d0.

This is the base package for medium models of incompressible fluids based on
tables. The minimal data to provide for a useful medium description is tables
of density and heat capacity as functions of temperature.
</p>

<p>It should be noted that incompressible media only have 1 state per control volume (usually T),
but have both T and p as inputs for fully correct properties. The error of using only T-dependent
properties is small, therefore a Boolean flag enthalpyOfT exists. If it is true, the
enumeration Choices.independentVariables  is set to  Choices.independentVariables.T otherwise
it is set to Choices.independentVariables.pT.</p>

<h4>Using the package TableBased</h4>
<p>
To implement a new medium model, create a package that <strong>extends</strong> TableBased
and provides one or more of the constant tables:
</p>

<pre>
tableDensity        = [T, d];
tableHeatCapacity   = [T, Cp];
tableConductivity   = [T, lam];
tableViscosity      = [T, eta];
tableVaporPressure  = [T, pVap];
</pre>

<p>
The table data is used to fit constant polynomials of order <strong>npol</strong>, the
temperature data points do not need to be same for different properties. Properties
like enthalpy, inner energy and entropy are calculated consistently from integrals
and derivatives of d(T) and Cp(T). The minimal
data for a useful medium model is thus density and heat capacity. Transport
properties and vapor pressure are optional, if the data tables are empty the corresponding
function calls can not be used.

<h4>Incompressible media package</h4>
<p>
This package provides a structure and examples of how to create simple
medium models of incompressible fluids, meaning fluids with very little
pressure influence on density. The medium properties is typically described
in terms of tables, functions or polynomial coefficients.
</p>
<h4>Definitions</h4>
<p>
The common meaning of <em>incompressible</em> is that properties like density
and enthalpy are independent of pressure. Thus properties are conveniently
described as functions of temperature, e.g., as polynomials density(T) and cp(T).
However, enthalpy can not be independent of pressure since h = u - p/d. For liquids
it is anyway
common to neglect this dependence since for constant density the neglected term
is (p - p0)/d, which in comparison with cp is very small for most liquids. For
water, the equivalent change of temperature to increasing pressure 1 bar is
0.025 Kelvin.
</p>
<p>
Two Boolean flags are used to choose how enthalpy and inner energy is calculated:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>enthalpyOfT</strong>=true, means assuming that enthalpy is only a function
of temperature, neglecting the pressure dependent term.</li>
<li><strong>singleState</strong>=true, means also neglect the pressure influence on inner
energy, which makes all medium properties pure functions of temperature.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The default setting for both these flags is true, which enables the simulation tool
to choose temperature as the only medium state and avoids non-linear equation
systems, see the section about
<a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Media.UsersGuide.MediumDefinition.StaticStateSelection\">Static
state selection</a> in the Modelica.Media User's Guide.
</p>

<h4>Contents</h4>
<p>
Currently, the package contains the following parts:
</p>
<ol>
<li> <a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Media.Incompressible.TableBased\">
      Table based medium models</a></li>
<li> <a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Media.Incompressible.Examples\">

</ol>

<p>
A few examples are given in the Examples package. The model
<a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Media.Incompressible.Examples.Glycol47\">

This model calculates medium properties
for water in the <strong>liquid</strong>, <strong>gas</strong> and <strong>two phase</strong> regions
according to the IAPWS/IF97 standard, i.e., the accepted industrial standard
and best compromise between accuracy and computation time.
For more details see <a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Media.Water.IF97_Utilities\">
Modelica.Media.Water.IF97_Utilities</a>. Three variable pairs can be the
independent variables of the model:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Pressure <strong>p</strong> and specific enthalpy <strong>h</strong> are the most natural choice for general applications. This is the recommended choice for most general purpose applications, in particular for power plants.</li>
<li>Pressure <strong>p</strong> and temperature <strong>T</strong> are the most natural choice for applications where water is always in the same phase, both for liquid water and steam.</li>
<li>Density <strong>d</strong> and temperature <strong>T</strong> are explicit variables of the Helmholtz function in the near-critical region and can be the best choice for applications with super-critical or near-critical states.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The following quantities are always computed:
</p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2>
  <tr><td><strong>Variable</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Unit</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr>
  <tr><td>T</td>
      <td>K</td>
      <td>temperature</td></tr>
  <tr><td>u</td>
      <td>J/kg</td>
      <td>specific internal energy</td></tr>
  <tr><td>d</td>
      <td>kg/m^3</td>
      <td>density</td></tr>
  <tr><td>p</td>
      <td>Pa</td>
      <td>pressure</td></tr>
  <tr><td>h</td>
      <td>J/kg</td>
      <td>specific enthalpy</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
In some cases additional medium properties are needed.
A component that needs these optional properties has to call
one of the functions listed in
<a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Media.UsersGuide.MediumUsage.OptionalProperties\">
Modelica.Media.UsersGuide.MediumUsage.OptionalProperties</a> and in
<a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Media.UsersGuide.MediumUsage.TwoPhase\">
Modelica.Media.UsersGuide.MediumUsage.TwoPhase</a>.
</p>
<p>Many further properties can be computed. Using the well-known Bridgman's Tables, all first partial derivatives of the standard thermodynamic variables can be computed easily.

 <p>Package <strong>Regions</strong> contains a large number of auxiliary functions which are needed to compute the current region
 of the IAPWS/IF97 for a given pair of input variables as quickly as possible. The focus of this implementation was on
 computational efficiency, not on compact code. Many of the function values calculated in these functions could be obtained
 using the fundamental functions of IAPWS/IF97, but with considerable overhead. If the region of IAPWS/IF97 is known in advance,
 the input variable mode can be set to the region, then the somewhat costly region checks are omitted.
 The checking for the phase has to be done outside the region functions because many properties are not
 differentiable at the region boundary. If the input phase is 2, the output region will be set to 4 immediately.</p>
 <h4>Package contents</h4>
 <p> The main 4 functions in this package are the functions returning the appropriate region for two input variables.</p>
 <ul>
 <li>Function <strong>region_ph</strong> compute the region of IAPWS/IF97 for input pair pressure and specific enthalpy.</li>
 <li>Function <strong>region_ps</strong> compute the region of IAPWS/IF97 for input pair pressure and specific entropy</li>
 <li>Function <strong>region_dT</strong> compute the region of IAPWS/IF97 for input pair density and temperature.</li>
 <li>Function <strong>region_pT</strong> compute the region of IAPWS/IF97 for input pair pressure and temperature (only in phase region).</li>
 </ul>
 <p>In addition, functions of the boiling and condensation curves compute the specific enthalpy, specific entropy, or density on these
 curves. The functions for the saturation pressure and temperature are included in the package <strong>Basic</strong> because they are part of
 the original <a href=\"modelica://Modelica/Resources/Documentation/Media/Water/IF97documentation/IF97.pdf\">IAPWS/IF97 standards document</a>. These functions are also aliased to
 be used directly from package <strong>Water</strong>.
</p>
 <ul>
 <li>Function <strong>hl_p</strong> computes the liquid specific enthalpy as a function of pressure. For overcritical pressures,

          <p>Package BaseIF97/Basic computes the fundamental functions for the 5 regions of the steam tables
          as described in the standards document <a href=\"modelica://Modelica/Resources/Documentation/Media/Water/IF97documentation/IF97.pdf\">IF97.pdf</a>. The code of these
          functions has been generated using <strong><em>Mathematica</em></strong> and the add-on packages \"Format\" and \"Optimize\"
          to generate highly efficient, expression-optimized C-code from a symbolic representation of the thermodynamic
          functions. The C-code has than been transformed into Modelica code. An important feature of this optimization was to
          simultaneously optimize the functions and the directional derivatives because they share many common subexpressions.</p>

          <li>Function <strong>cond_dTp</strong> implements a function to compute  the industrial formulation of the thermal conductivity of water as
          a function of density, temperature and pressure. <strong>Important note</strong>: Obviously only two of the three
          inputs are really needed, but using three inputs speeds up the computation and the three variables are known in most models anyways.
          The inputs d,T and p have to be consistent.

        <p>In September 1997, the International Association for the Properties
        of Water and Steam (<a href=\"http://www.iapws.org\">IAPWS</a>) adopted a
        new formulation for the thermodynamic properties of water and steam for
        industrial use. This new industrial standard is called \"IAPWS Industrial
        Formulation for the Thermodynamic Properties of Water and Steam\" (IAPWS-IF97).
        The formulation IAPWS-IF97 replaces the previous industrial standard IFC-67.</p>
        <p>Based on this new formulation, a new steam table, titled \"<a href=\"http://www.springer.de/cgi-bin/search_book.pl?isbn=3-540-64339-7\">Properties of Water and Steam</a>\" by W. Wagner and A. Kruse, was published by
        the Springer-Verlag, Berlin - New-York - Tokyo in April 1998. This
        steam table, ref. <a href=\"#steamprop\">[1]</a> is bilingual (English /
        German) and contains a complete description of the equations of
        IAPWS-IF97. This reference is the authoritative source of information
        for this implementation. A mostly identical version has been published by the International
        Association for the Properties
        of Water and Steam (<a href=\"http://www.iapws.org\">IAPWS</a>) with permission granted to re-publish the
        information if credit is given to IAPWS. This document is distributed with this library as
        <a href=\"modelica://Modelica/Resources/Documentation/Media/Water/IF97documentation/IF97.pdf\">IF97.pdf</a>.
        In addition, the equations published by <a href=\"http://www.iapws.org\">IAPWS</a> for
        the transport properties dynamic viscosity (standards document: <a href=\"modelica://Modelica/Resources/Documentation/Media/Water/IF97documentation/visc.pdf\">visc.pdf</a>)
        and thermal conductivity (standards document: <a href=\"modelica://Modelica/Resources/Documentation/Media/Water/IF97documentation/thcond.pdf\">thcond.pdf</a>)
        and equations for the surface tension (standards document: <a href=\"modelica://Modelica/Resources/Documentation/Media/Water/IF97documentation/surf.pdf\">surf.pdf</a>)
        are also implemented in this library and included for reference.</p>
        <p>
        The functions in BaseIF97.mo are low level functions which should
        only be used in those exceptions when the standard user level
        functions in Water.mo do not contain the wanted properties.
     </p>
<p>Based on IAPWS-IF97, Modelica functions are available for calculating
the most common thermophysical properties (thermodynamic and transport
properties). The implementation requires part of the common medium
property infrastructure of the Modelica.Thermal.Properties library in the file
Common.mo. There are a few extensions from the version of IF97 as
documented in <a href=\"modelica://Modelica/Resources/Documentation/Media/Water/IF97documentation/IF97.pdf\">IF97.pdf</a> in order to improve performance for
dynamic simulations. Input variables for calculating the properties are
only implemented for a limited number of variable pairs which make sense as dynamic states: (p,h), (p,T), (p,s) and (d,T).

Figure 1 shows the 5 regions into which the entire range of validity of
IAPWS-IF97 is divided. The boundaries of the regions can be directly taken
from Fig. 1 except for the boundary between regions 2 and 3; this boundary,
which corresponds approximately to the isentropic line <span class=\"nobr\"><em>s</em> = 5.047 kJ kg
<sup>-1</sup>K<sup>-1</sup></span>, is defined
by a corresponding auxiliary equation. Both regions 1 and 2 are individually
covered by a fundamental equation for the specific Gibbs free energy <span class=\"nobr\"><em>g</em>( <em>p</em>,<em>T</em> )</span>, region 3 by a fundamental equation for the specific Helmholtz
free energy <span class=\"nobr\"><em>f </em>(<em> <font face=\"symbol\">r</font></em>,<em>T
</em>)</span>, and the saturation curve, corresponding to region 4, by a saturation-pressure
equation <span><em>p</em><sub>s</sub>( <em>T</em> )</span>. The high-temperature
region 5 is also covered by a <span class=\"nobr\"><em>g</em>( <em>p</em>,<em>T</em> )</span> equation. These
5 equations, shown in rectangular boxes in Fig. 1, form the so-called <em>basic
equations</em>.

In addition to these basic equations, so-called <em>backward
equations</em> are provided for regions 1, 2, and 4 in form of
<span class=\"nobr\"><em>T</em>( <em>p</em>,<em>h</em> )</span> and <span class=\"nobr\"><em>T</em>( <em>
p</em>,<em>s</em> )</span> for regions 1 and 2, and <span class=\"nobr\"><em>T</em><sub>s</sub>( <em>p</em> )</span> for region 4. These
backward equations, marked in grey in Fig. 1, were developed in such a
way that they are numerically very consistent with the corresponding
basic equation. Thus, properties as functions of&nbsp; <em>p</em>,<em>h
</em>and of&nbsp;<em> p</em>,<em>s </em>for regions 1 and 2, and of
<em>p</em> for region 4 can be calculated without any iteration. As a
result of this special concept for the development of the new
industrial standard IAPWS-IF97, the most important properties can be
calculated extremely quickly. All Modelica functions are optimized
with regard to short computing times.

        <p>The properties 1-11 are calculated by default with the functions for dynamic
        simulation, 2 of these variables are the dynamic states and are the inputs
        to calculate all other properties. In addition to these properties
        of general interest, the entries to the thermodynamic Jacobian matrix which render
        the mass- and energy balances explicit in the input variables to the property calculation are also calculated.

      <a href=\"modelica://Modelica/Resources/Documentation/Media/Water/IF97documentation/IF97.pdf\">IF97.pdf</a>. The explicit backwards equations for region 3 from
      <a href=\"modelica://Modelica/Resources/Documentation/Media/Water/IF97documentation/Back3.pdf\">Back3.pdf</a> are implemented as initial values for an inverse iteration of the exact
      function in IF97 for the input pairs (p,h) and (p,s).
      The low-level functions in BaseIF97 are not needed for standard simulation usage,
      but can be useful for experts and some special purposes.</li>
      <li>Function <strong>water_ph</strong> returns all properties needed for a dynamic control volume model and properties of general
      interest using pressure p and specific entropy enthalpy h as dynamic states in the record ThermoProperties_ph.</li>
      <li>Function <strong>water_ps</strong> returns all properties needed for a dynamic control volume model and properties of general
      interest using pressure p and specific entropy s as dynamic states in the record ThermoProperties_ps.</li>
      <li>Function <strong>water_dT</strong> returns all properties needed for a dynamic control volume model and properties of general
      interest using density d and temperature T as dynamic states in the record ThermoProperties_dT.</li>
      <li>Function <strong>water_pT</strong> returns all properties needed for a dynamic control volume model and properties of general
      interest using pressure p and temperature T as dynamic states in the record ThermoProperties_pT. Due to the coupling of
      pressure and temperature in the two-phase region, this model can obviously
      only be used for one-phase models or models treating both phases independently.</li>
      <li>Function <strong>hl_p</strong> computes the liquid specific enthalpy as a function of pressure. For overcritical pressures,
      the critical specific enthalpy is returned</li>
      <li>Function <strong>hv_p</strong> computes the vapour specific enthalpy as a function of pressure. For overcritical pressures,
      the critical specific enthalpy is returned</li>
      <li>Function <strong>sl_p</strong> computes the liquid specific entropy as a function of pressure. For overcritical pressures,
      the critical  specific entropy is returned</li>

      the critical  specific entropy is returned</li>
      <li>Function <strong>rhol_T</strong> computes the liquid density as a function of temperature. For overcritical temperatures,
      the critical density is returned</li>
      <li>Function <strong>rhol_T</strong> computes the vapour density as a function of temperature. For overcritical temperatures,
      the critical density is returned</li>
      <li>Function <strong>dynamicViscosity</strong> computes the dynamic viscosity as a function of density and temperature.</li>
      <li>Function <strong>thermalConductivity</strong> computes the thermal conductivity as a function of density, temperature and pressure.
      <strong>Important note</strong>: Obviously only two of the three
      inputs are really needed, but using three inputs speeds up the computation and the three variables
      are known in most models anyways. The inputs d,T and p have to be consistent.</li>
      <li>Function <strong>surfaceTension</strong> computes the surface tension between vapour
          and liquid water as a function of temperature.</li>
      <li>Function <strong>isentropicEnthalpy</strong> computes the specific enthalpy h(p,s,phase) in all regions.
          The phase input is needed due to discontinuous derivatives at the phase boundary.</li>
      <li>Function <strong>dynamicIsentropicEnthalpy</strong> computes the specific enthalpy h(p,s,,dguess,Tguess,phase) in all regions.
          The phase input is needed due to discontinuous derivatives at the phase boundary. Tguess and dguess are initial guess
          values for the density and temperature consistent with p and s. This function should be preferred in
          dynamic simulations where good guesses are often available.</li>

<h4>Overview of WaterIF97 derived water models</h4>
<p>
The WaterIF97 models calculate medium properties
for water in the <strong>liquid</strong>, <strong>gas</strong> and <strong>two phase</strong> regions
according to the IAPWS/IF97 standard, i.e., the accepted industrial standard
and best compromise between accuracy and computation time.
It has been part of the ThermoFluid Modelica library and been extended,
reorganized and documented to become part of the Modelica Standard library.</p>
<p>An important feature that distinguishes this implementation of the IF97 steam property standard
is that this implementation has been explicitly designed to work well in dynamic simulations. Computational
performance has been of high importance. This means that there often exist several ways to get the same result
from different functions if one of the functions is called often but can be optimized for that purpose.
</p>
<p>Three variable pairs can be the independent variables of the model:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Pressure <strong>p</strong> and specific enthalpy <strong>h</strong> are
    the most natural choice for general applications.
    This is the recommended choice for most general purpose
    applications, in particular for power plants.</li>
<li>Pressure <strong>p</strong> and temperature <strong>T</strong> are the most natural
    choice for applications where water is always in the same phase,
    both for liquid water and steam.</li>
<li>Density <strong>d</strong> and temperature <strong>T</strong> are explicit
    variables of the Helmholtz function in the near-critical
    region and can be the best choice for applications with
    super-critical or near-critical states.</li>
</ol>

Many additional optional functions are defined to compute properties of
saturated media, either liquid (bubble point) or vapour (dew point).
The argument to such functions is a SaturationProperties record, which can be
set starting from either the saturation pressure or the saturation temperature.
With reference to a model defining a pressure p, a temperature T, and a
SaturationProperties record sat, the following functions are provided:
