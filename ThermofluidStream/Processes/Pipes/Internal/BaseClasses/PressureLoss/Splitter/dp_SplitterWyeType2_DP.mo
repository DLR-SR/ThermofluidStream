The implementation of the function is based on \"Handbook of Hydraulic Resistance\" in its first translated Version from 1960! The book has been republished in several updated versions since then!
Function calculating the pressure loss of a Y-shaped splitter of type II (<strong>Fig. 1</strong>) as f(w_c,w_b,w_s, alpha, rho, k, K'_b). (Currently not yet available)
</p>

<ul>
<li>w_c: velocity at common channel [m/s]</li>
<li>w_b: velocity at branching channel [m/s]</li>
<li>w_s: velocity at straight channel [m/s]</li>
<li>alpha: branching angle [rad]</li>
<li>rho: density [kg/m^3]</li>
<li>k: scaling factor for area ratio dependency at alpha = 90° [-]</li>
<li>K'_b: correction factor for branching angle dependency [-]</li>
</ul>

<p>
Calculation according to Idelchik (1960). The pressure loss is calculated as:
</p>

<ul>
<li>in branch: <code>dp_b = rho/2 * zeta_cb * w_c^2</code></li>
<li>in straight channel: <code>dp_s = rho/2 * zeta_cs * w_c^2</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
As you can see above both pressure loss calculation are with respect to the velocity at the common branch. The <strong>pressure loss coefficient of the branch zeta_cb</strong> is calculated as:
</p>

<p>
<code>zeta_cb =1 + (w_relbc)^2 - 2*w_relbc *cos(alpha) - K'_b * (w_relbc)^2</code>
</p>

<p>
Idel'chik provides table data for the coefficient K'_b. Since no sufficiently precise approximation equation can be defined for this factor, a table is also used for implementation.
A cubic spline is used to interpolate between the control points. To control the limit behavior at table boundaries control points at alpha = 0° and alpha = 105° are added
</p>

<p>
<strong>Notice:</strong> In more recent editions Idelchik gives the same approximation formula, but the diagram and data sets show a limit value against which the friction coefficients of all angles converge.
Adjustments using a C-spline have not yet been made. For calculation of the <strong>pressure loss coefficient of th straight channel zeta_cs</strong> there is no aproximation formula by Idel'chik.
Therefore an own aproximation on basis of the data from Idel'chik has to be found. The given table data suggest a basis function, which is transformed into a set of curves by the scaling factor k 
taking the area ratio dependency at <code>alpha = 90°</code> into account.
</p>

<p>
A 4th order polynomial is selected as the basis function and fitted to the data set:
</p>

<p>
<code> zeta_cs_base = 0.5345*w_relsc^4 - 1.124+w_relsc^3 + 1.73*w_relsc^2 - 2.146*w_relsc + 1.005</code>
</p>

<p>
In order to obtain a set of curves. the basis function is expanded by the scaling factor k.
</p>

<p>
<code> zeta_cs = k*0.5345*w_relsc^4 - k*1.124+w_relsc^3 + k*1.73*w_relsc^2 - 2.146*w_relsc + 1.005</code>
</p>

<p>
As befor since no rational approximation has been found the scaling factor is implemented using a look-up table.
