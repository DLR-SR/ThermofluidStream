<strong>The implementation of the function is based on \"Handbook of Hydraulic Resistance\" in its first translated Version from 1960! The book has been republished in several updated versions since then!<strong>

Function calculating the pressure loss of a Y-shaped junction of type I (<strong>Fig. 1</strong>, currently not yet available) as f(F_c, F_b, w_c, w_b, w_s, alpha, rho, k, A), where:


<ul>
<li>F_c: cross sectional area of common channel [m^2]</li>
<li>F_b: cross sectional area of branch [m^2]</li>
<li>w_c: velocity at common channel [m/s]</li>
<li>w_b: velocity at branching channel [m/s]</li>
<li>w_s: velocity at straight channel [m/s]</li>
<li>alpha: branching angle [rad]</li>
<li>rho: density [kg/m^3]</li>
<li>k: coefficient of branching angle dependency [-]</li>
<li>A: coefficient of area ratio dependency [-]</li>
</ul>

<p>
Calculation according to Idelchik (1960). The pressure loss is calculated as:
</p>

<ul>
<li>in branch: <code>dp_b = rho/2 * zeta_cb * w_c^2</code></li>
<li>in straight channel: <code>dp_s = rho/2 * zeta_cs * w_c^2</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
As you can see above both pressure loss calculation are with respect to the velocity at the common branch. The <strong>pressure loss coefficient of the branch zeta_cb</strong> is 
calculated for case 1 (alpha &lt;= 60°) as: <code>zeta_cb = 1 + w_relbc^2 - 2*(1-*Q_relbc)^2 * k * F_relcb*(Q_relbc)^2</code>
</p>

<ul>
<li>w_relbc = w_b/w_c: velocity ratio</li>
<li>Q_relbc = Q_b/Q_c: volume flow ratio</li>
<li>F_relbc = F_b/F_c area ratio</li>
</ul>

<p>
With coefficient k taking the branching angle depedency into account. k is approximated using a 3rd order polynomial:
</p>

<p>
<code>k(alpha°) = -0.0001766 * alpha^2 - 0.007536 * alpha + 2.1043</code>
</p>

<p>
For case 2 (alpha = 90°): <code>zeta_cb = A * [A + w_relbc^2 - 2*(1 - Q_relbc)^2] = A * zeta'_cb</code>, with coefficient A scaling zeta'_cb with respect to the given area ratio F_relbc. 
Since no rational approimation of A = f(F_relbc) has been found, the coefficient is implemented as a table with cubic spline interpolation between the control points.
</p>

  <tr>
    <td>F_relbc</td>
    <td>0-0.2</td>
    <td>0.3-0.4</td>
    <td>0.6</td>
    <td>0.8</td>

<p>
For case 3 (60° &lt; alpha &lt;90°): Since there is no aproximation formula nor data available in this case zeta_cb is interpolated linear between the function of case 1 and 2.
The <strong>pressure loss coefficient of the straight channel zeta_cs</strong> is calculated as:
</p>

<ul>
<li>case 1 (alpha &lt;= 60°): <code>zeta_cs = 1 - (1 - Q_relbc)^2 - k * F_relbc * Q_relbc^2</code>, where k is the same coefficient discribed above. </li>
<li>case 2 (alpha = 90°): <code>zeta_cs = 1.55 * Q_relbc - Q_relbc^2</code></li>
<li>case 3 (60° &lt; alpha &lt;90°): As before linear interpolation between the function at alpha &lt;= 60 and alpha = 90 is used to determine the pressure loss in case 3.</li>
