This is the <strong>Fluid</strong> fork by <strong>HTWG Konstanz</strong> containing <strong>piping components</strong> as well as 
<strong>water turbines </strong>(Pelton and Francis) fitted to the DLR library <strong>ThermofluidStream</strong>.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>Pipes Package</strong> consists of regulary straight pipes (including heat transfer), bends, flow contraction and expansion as well as flow con- and diverging components.
</p>

<p>
In the <strong>HydroPower Package</strong> components modelling hydraulic turbines (Pelton and Francis) can be found.
</p>

<p>
All components provided in this fork have been developed by HTWG Konstanz graduate Philipp Jordan under academic supervision by Prof. Dr. Peter Stein.
